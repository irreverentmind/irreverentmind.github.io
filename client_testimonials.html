Since finding you, it is rarely there and when it is, I am on to it like a ton of bricks. I get as much facilitation as I can, because it works."<br /><br />"I've been claustrophobic and had panic attacks for years. Airports and airplanes freaked me out. I am at the airport now waiting to board our plane. Judy I am so f**n fine it's not even funny!!!!! Actually enjoying the experience. Wow!!!!"  <br /><br />"These sessions with you have been magic.
