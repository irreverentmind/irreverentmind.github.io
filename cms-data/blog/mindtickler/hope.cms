I\u2019m thinking, \u201cOh honey, no.\u201d<br><br>I mean, of course I get that humans love a good hope. Who doesn\u2019t love those wishes and yearnings for happiness, better feelings, better circumstances? Who isn\u2019t counting on them to turn into actualities, simply by the power of our wanting?<br><br>Surely we can <em>think<\/em> life into giving us what we want.<br><br>Although it\u2019s not like, even if we have enough hope, life will actually come through with what is hoped for.<br><br>There is no actual connection between hoping and getting.<br><br>Meanwhile, usually it\u2019s unnoticed how that kind of wishful yearning makes things in the here and now.<br><br>Because hope is all about later-&nbsp;a better-than-this tomorrow, a better-than-this life. Next time! Looking forward.<br><br>Making what\u2019s actually here now feel lacking, inadequate, not enough.<br><br>Yes it might feel very true that what\u2019s present in this current life is miserable, suffering, not ok.<br><br>Of course we\u2019d want to wish all that away with hope.<br><br>It just that when our focus is on a better<em>&nbsp;later,<\/em> it becomes difficult to notice or value anything good in the actual present.<br><br>When the experience is, \u201cThis sucks, I need something better,\u201d we\u2019re not going to notice what\u2019s good right now.<br><br>Hope is the opposite of enough. Hope is the opposite of good. Hope is the opposite of <em>This Is It.<\/em><br><br>I mean, yeah this may be It, but give us a better It, wouldja?

Nothing wrong with that.<br><br>It\u2019s just that if the current experience includes depression or anxiety or addiction, hope subtly, quietly, actually, makes things worse.<br><br>So just for novelty and because why not, it might be fun to put attention on something else for a change.<br><br>It might be fun to notice the present, notice what\u2019s literally good enough right now, notice what doesn\u2019t need improvement right now.<br><br>A body, able to feel.
