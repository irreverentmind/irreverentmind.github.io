They want to find the no-I. They want to find the awareness of it.<br><br>Where is that sucker? Folks are looking everywhere for it.<br><br>Which does raise the question, why? Why would anyone feel it\u2019s necessary to understand no-self?<br><br>Clearly there\u2019s an idea that some-thing can be gotten, if only one can see there\u2019s no-thing.<br><br>Hmmm ok. Maybe it would help to ask, what wants to know? What gives a darn about this important question?<br><br>Well, I\u2019m sorry to report, but that would be the self. It\u2019s the self that wants to know.<br><br>Self wants to find not-I, by using I to do it.<br><br>So naturally, all it ever finds is itself. Over and over and over.<br><br>Which makes sense, really. After all, what are the odds that anything would ever truly want to discover its own non-existence?<br><br>Slim odds at best.<br><br>And then, whoo hoo! Some folks think they do finally get it.<br><br>But then they feel depressed, or low, or unmotivated to leave the couch.<br><br>Which is often when they start saying things like, \u201cWell, what\u2019s the point, if there is no I? Why bother?\u201d<br><br>Oh the I feels blue. The I feels worthless, pointless, frustrated, confused.<br><br>Yes, it claims to earnestly want to lose itself, and then feels sad when it supposedly succeeds.<br><br>Good ol\u2019 self, with its many feelings, feeling stuff.<br><br>The thing is, feelings come to the one who has, the one who owns, a body.<br><br>Making said body-owner the center of everything important.<br><br>Which sounds very self-like, not very not-I, to me.<br><br>But ok.<br><br>And then, even if we perhaps discover that what we are is consciousness experiencing itself through us,<br><br>then there\u2019s consciousness and also the I doing the experiencing for consciousness.<br><br>Meaning there are two things. And surprise! One of those things is the self.<br><br>Seems nothing at all can be experienced, except through it.<br><br>Making the I very darned important.<br><br>As usual.<br><br>It seems there is no way to escape the hamster wheel of self. Because it\u2019s what\u2019s doing the looking.<br><br>Y\u2019know, for its not-self.&nbsp;Supposedly.<br><br>So perhaps there\u2019s nothing to lose by trying something off-wheel.<br><br>Such as, take the \u201cer\u201d out.<br><br>Take the \"er\" out of feel-er, think-er, own-er of bodies. Take the \"er\" out of know-er, and connect-er to awareness.<br><br>The \u201cer\u201d assumes a do-er, a self-er, a receiver.<br><br>Taking the \"er\" out, de-centers.<br><br>Try on the possibility that there is nothing&nbsp;doing&nbsp;the feeling and thinking and witnessing and connecting.<br><br>Why would this matter? Well, if there's no \"er\", then how can experience happen?&nbsp;What\u2019s left, without self-ers?<br><br>Happenings. Lots and lots and lots of happenings.<br><br>Not knowers of happenings. Not awarenesses of happenings.<br><br>Just happenings.<br><br>Instead of experience-er of things, it\u2019s simply all actual experience.<br><br>Thought, sensation, color, sound, understanding. All of it.<br><br>Being. Everything.<br><br>The I disappears.<br><br>And wouldn't it be something if being decentered-everything<br><br>more than makes up for any sense of loss some tiny pinpoint speck of the universe which thinks everything depends on its happy existence, might feel.<br><br>I mean, it\u2019s just possible that being everything is pretty cool,<br><br>and that nothing at all misses<br><br>that limited, teeny-tiny,<br><br>self-important,<br><br>pretend-center,<br><br>full-of-nothing,<br><br>I.<br><br><br><em><br>\"I've been searching for years for the ideal place.
