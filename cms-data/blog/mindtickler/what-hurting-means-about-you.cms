Maybe even a lot of us.<br><br>Some are not sleeping, or too heavy to get out of bed many mornings, or waking in the middle of the night in a panic. Some have trouble saying no to wine, food, sex or love. Some of us procrastinate. Some don\u2019t have money, hate our jobs, the spouse is cheating or abusive, the kids are struggling or ignoring us.<br><br>Gosh there\u2019s no lack of troublesome situations in this human existence, huh?<br><br>Seems there\u2019s an infinite number of ways to generate anything from mild annoyance to anguished despair.<br><br>No, things are NOT ok as they are, thank you very much, all you weird supposedly-blissed-out spiritual gurus. No.<br><br>And life continues to bring situations. It\u2019s not like that\u2019s ever going to stop. We\u2019re certainly never going to be able to change, fix or preempt every possible circumstance that might potentially bring pain.<br><br>So since that\u2019s impossible, something different might make sense.<br><br>So think of any situation that is a problem. And then ask\u2026<br><br>What does this situation mean about Me?<br><br>And notice that there is an answer to that question.<br><br>It'll be some version of, \u201cThis situation means I AM\u2026 weak, a failure, unlovable, bad, lazy, not enough, not a good parent, damaged.\u201d<br><br>That's because some version of, \u201cThis means x-y-z about me.\u201d is actually the common denominator to every emotional pain, anger, unhappiness we experience in life.<br><br>In fact situations that don\u2019t carry any self-meaning or self-defining are somehow... not painful. When there\u2019s no reflection of the Me \u2026<br><br>Those situations don\u2019t hurt.<br><br>Meaning about the Me is required in order for us to experience a problem in any given circumstance. &nbsp;<br><br>Isn\u2019t that amazing?<br><br>It's all about the Me. Always.<br><br>So it seems we each really are the center of the universe. <br><br>Through pain, we define ourselves into existence.<br><br>That\u2019s what suffering is for, and why problems seem to keep coming.<br><br>So that the story of Me-as-the-center-of-everything can continue.<br><br>This is good news, actually. Because it turns out we don't have to continue the hopeless task of changing or protecting against every circumstance in the universe.<br><br>Instead, we are in a better position to consider\u2026What if this painful situation- as it is- means absolutely nothing about me? What if I\u2019m not the center of things, what if it all doesn\u2019t \u201creflect back\u201d some meaning about me or onto me?<br><br>What if those zeroes on my bank statement mean nothing about me? What if that expression on my kid\u2019s face means nothing about me? What if no sleep or this heaviness or that word means nothing about me?<br><br>What would that feel like?<br><br>It\u2019s just possible that the very same situations might no longer be experienced as problems.<br><br>It\u2019s just possible that troubles, reactions and unhappiness-es might go poof.<br><br>Which would also mean nothing about you, of course.<br><br>But it would feel better.<br><br>And that would probably be just fine with the Me, at least for a little while.<br>","extra":""}
