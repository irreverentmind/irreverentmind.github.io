No fear is so small or petty that the fear of no-self isn't at its heart.<br>All fear is ultimately fear of no-self.\"<br>--Jed McKenna<br><br>----------<br><br>\"There is no oasis situated yonder; you are stuck with the mirage.\"<br>--U.G. Krishnamurti<br><\/em><br><br><br>\u200bLe sigh.<br><br>So this week\u2019s Mind-Tickler started out like so many previous ones, using everyday language and everyday examples to reveal, for the millionth time, that you don\u2019t exist.<br><br>Yep, that again.<br><br>This one started out using examples of what we call \u201cintroverted and extroverted,\u201d in yet another weekly attempt to help you see that everything is all really about the protection of the sense of self.<br><br>The self that doesn\u2019t exist. The self that can\u2019t be found.<br><br>And then I got tired, and cut out all the blahdeeblah and cut right to the chase. Again.<br><br>Because as I\u2019ve said so often before, in so many ways, with so many everyday life examples, there is no you, there is no self, there is no mind, there is no ego, there is no personality, there is no insert-your-name-here.<br><br>I know, I\u2019m sorry, I really am. But there is none.<br><br>Ok but why, friendly Mind-Tickler, does everything keep coming back to this, over and over and over?<br><br>Because it\u2019s the prime directive. Because it drives every experience you have. Because every situation in every life boils down to,<em> You are not what you think you are.<\/em><br><br>And yes, I know, you\u2019re \u201cright here,\u201d pointing vaguely in the direction of a clavicle. And yes, I know there\u2019s a strong sense of you.<br><br>Got it. So what?<br><br>As if that \u201csense,\u201d which comes with the obligatory announcement, <em>But I feel it! <\/em>proves anything.<br><br>Because what the hell is \u201ca sense\u201d anyway?<br><br>More nothing, that\u2019s what.<br><br>And the thing is, when you focus on what you sense or think or see- when you focus on what you experience- as the way of proving that you are indeed <em>right here<\/em>, your ability to be clear is instantly skewed and off.<br><br>Because focusing on what you&nbsp;sense&nbsp;inserts you, solidifies you, reifies you, as&nbsp;<em>The One Things Happen To.<\/em><br><br>That \u201cSense\u201d creates you as a person.<br><br>Not the other way around.<br><br>So maybe you can imagine what pretending you\u2019re something when actually you\u2019re nothing, might feel like.<br><br>What does it feel like being a unicorn and living a whole life terrified to find out you\u2019re made up?<br><br>Imagine being in constant fear of having this charade be seen and exposed.<br><br>In everyday life, this might look like caring what others think about you, working to make the boss or social media think you\u2019re great, trying to look nonchalant and say the right thing in social situations, or staying in and not going out at all.<br><br>All in an attempt to control what others see and think. About you.<br><br>Because the image, the facade, the presentation, must be controlled. Others must not see the wispy nothing you know you are.<br><br>As if those scary, dangerous and able-to-see-you others are any more real than you.<br><br>Welcome to human, unicorn.<br><br>The self has only one job.<em> Pretend this is real. Don\u2019t let on.<\/em><br><br>The constant fear of exposure drives everything.<br><br>Turns out, that background hum of,&nbsp;<em>Something isn\u2019t right,<\/em>&nbsp;which so many folks experience, is correct.<br><br>Luckily, as usual, none of this matters. Everyday life goes on.<br><br>So forget that \u201cstrong sense\u201d of being you for just a minute. It may be there but it simply doesn\u2019t matter.<br><br>Instead, try on BEING the things that are happening, as opposed to <em>The One W<\/em>ho feels them or <em>The One Who<\/em> is aware of them.<br><br>You don't have to believe this to try it on.<br><br>Try on&nbsp;being,&nbsp;as in literally it's what you&nbsp;are- every word, every thought, every feeling, every memory, every story, every color, every sound.<br><br>Being all that. Non-stop fluid, changeable,&nbsp;infinitely varied.&nbsp;Unable to be held and kept.<br><br>Being the happenings.<br><br>Not the happening-to.<br><br>Not the watching or watchER, either.<br><br>What then?
