Ouch.<br><br>Uncooperative landlords, bad teachers, unkind strangers? No, no, no.<br><br>Romantic partner who cheats or doesn't care? Not. Happy.<br><br>We like things our way, and our way only.<br><br>We say, \u201cNo way I can be happy or OK with this going on.\u201d<br><br>And yet whether we like a given situation or we don\u2019t, things often don\u2019t go our way anyway.<br><br>You may have noticed.<br><br>We pout, tantrum, complain and project a ruined future. &nbsp;<br><br>We get depressed, isolated, suicidal, angry.<br><br>Attempting to limit disappointments and unhappiness, we place rules, obligations and requirements on experience.<br><br>\"Come on, life. I should be healthy, thinner, younger. &nbsp;I need a loving partner. I need more money. I need friends. I need more time. I shouldn't have to sit here for so long. They should love me. He shouldn't talk to me like that. I'm still not enlightened? Jeez, what's it gonna take?\"<br><br>Gosh, are our likes and wants so important that everything - our peace, our contentment, our quality of life- depends on them?<br><br>And does it even make sense to have our satisfaction and OKness depend on constantly changing, totally uncontrollable circumstances?<br><br>I mean, not liking traffic doesn't make us happier. Not liking sickness doesn't improve sickness. Not liking the situation at work doesn't improve the situation.<br><br>It could be that these demands actually make us more unhappy and give us even more of what we don\u2019t want.<br><br>So instead of insisting that things go our way, we might just notice that we are actually, literally OK, even though the various current situations are happening.<br><br>Because aren't we?<br><br>Person sitting, standing, thinking, feeling.<br><br>Not much else going on, is there?<br><br>Even with the broken car, the lying friend, the lost child, what's not actually OK?<br><br>Just a feeling we don't like.<br><br>Displeased with situations or not, uncomfortable or not, OKness is here.<br><br>We can even see this for ourselves by just asking: &nbsp;What percentage of me is OK right now, even with this situation?<br><br>Whatever number we come up with, doesn't that amount of OKness count at all?<br><br>Do things have to be 100% to our liking, for whatever percentage of OKness to be enough?<br><br>You hear the petulance in that, right?<br><br>As if we pout enough we can make experience bend to our wishes.<br><br>But instead, experience does its own thing, its own way. Life and death happens as it happens, on its terms not ours.<br><br>So there will always be another unwanted situation, another problem, another \u201dNoooo!\u201d<br><br>In fact at any given moment there will probably be lots of complaints and \"I don't like this!\" going on.<br><br>We will never be problem or complaint free.<br><br>Things we don't like are going to keep happening.<br><br>So if we\u2019re dependent on conditions to be right to be happy, we\u2019re bound to be disappointed.<br><br>Because it\u2019s impossible.<br><br>That\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t make much sense to put contentment on hold while we wait for everything to be just right.<br><br>I mean, sure, we can wait for everything to fall into place before we are happy and OK.<br><br>But I can\u2019t imagine why we\u2019d want to.<br><br>Because we\u2019d be waiting a very long time.<br><br>And because really, why wait for what\u2019s here already?<br>","extra":""}
