I did something wrong. I should have known better. I am a terrible parent and a terrible person.\u201d<br><br>We are identified. We exist. We know who and what we are.<br><br>The pain tells us.<br><br>\u201cI hurt, therefore I am.\u201d<br><br>And then we might start to notice that we don\u2019t really want all that wretched sorrow to end.<br><br>Because to feel better when a child is gone feels like we\u2019re betraying our love.<br><br>And because we don\u2019t want to wear the identity of \u201cunloving\u201d, so grief is held onto, often for years.<br><br>There\u2019s even a sense, what with all the personal fault and responsibility involved, that we deserve the misery, as punishment for not keeping the child alive.<br><br>So that mourning becomes a punishment for existing.<br><br>Now of course not everyone has experienced the death of a child, and if that is the case for you, hopefully that remains so.<br><br>But everyone has had someone they love, die. So we\u2019ve all seen how this works.<br><br>\u201cWhat will I do without them? Who will be my rock? How will I ever get over this?\u201d<br><br>That\u2019s not about the loved one. That\u2019s about The Me.<br><br>As always, the Center of All Things.<br><br>And the more self is involved and identified, the greater the pain.<br><br>How much we hurt comes down to the amount of self involvement.<br><br>So if there is a death in our life which was or remains extremely painful, whether it was a child or not,<br><br>We can look to the personal. Look to responsibility. Look to identity.<br><br>Look to the self.<br><br>We can watch it insert itself into life and death and all manner of other places it does not belong.<br><br>Attempting to confirm, via continuing pain, that we are.<br><br>Because above all else, the self fears being seen to be nothing.<br><br>Besides, let\u2019s face it, there\u2019s no way anyone can turn a situation like a child\u2019s death into a Krishnamurti-esque, \u201cI don\u2019t mind what happens.\u201d<br><br>No. &nbsp;<br><br>We can expect to hurt. Expect to cry, and miss, and regret and ruminate and feel guilty.<br><br>Expect to think about the life a beautiful little girl might have had, but now, won\u2019t.<br><br>There\u2019s no getting around it, no matter how enlightened anyone might be.<br><br>Really, who would want that kind of one-note robotic existence, anyway?<br><br>But if ever the pain becomes too much, we can know that it has nothing to do with the deceased loved one.<br><br>And everything to do with the Me.<br><br>Which might enable us to come back to loving, honoring, and celebrating that little life,<br><br>which is now complete.<br><br>That is the opposite of self-ish.<br><br>That is true love.<br><br>And nothing is responsible for that love but<br><br>Itself.<br><br><br><em>\"The ending of the illusion is the ending of 'you'. That is the death.\"<br>--U.G.Krishnamurti<br><br>----------<br><br>\"Death has nothing to do with going away.<br>The sun sets.
