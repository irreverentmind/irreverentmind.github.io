I live in the land of black widow spiders and other bitey things, so that spot was not to be ignored. I got closer and saw \u2026 there was nothing there.<br><br>Yup I distinctly saw something that wasn\u2019t there.<br><br>Perhaps you spiritual types can guess where I\u2019m goin\u2019 with this.<br><br>This Me, the Myself-thingy we all speak of with such authority, such certainty\u2026 I shall herewith call it Spot.<br><br>Because look more closely and\u2026 it ain\u2019t there.<br><br>Oh it does feel like the self is there. It does feel like, \u201cOf course there\u2019s a me!\u201d &nbsp;Right?<br><br>Yeah. I was sure I saw a spot today too.<br><br>\u201cFeels like\u201d and \u201cseems like\u201d are both useless and uninformative when it comes to Spot.<br><br>So let\u2019s just get the proof out of the way shall we? &nbsp;<br><br>You\u2019ve heard ad nauseam that we are not the body. That means if I ask you to point to You, to the Self, to Spot, and you turn an index finger towards that body and happily say, \u201cI\u2019m right here!\u201d, well, what exactly are you pointing to?<br><br>Are you saying the cheeks, collarbone, nose hairs- they\u2019re what you are? Or the brain or heart- are you saying if you take them out of the body and put them on a table, they\u2019ll do anything more than just sit there like the meat they are?<br><br>Nah that stuff isn\u2019t You.<br><br>Or perhaps it \u201cfeels like\u201d your Self is inside - in the head maybe, or the chest. Although, I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s no little you in there, sitting on a chaise lounge popping bonbons, wondering what took you so long to find him or her.<br><br>No, no MRI has ever revealed the Self, because there\u2019s no place or location for it inside the body.<br><br>Besides, if Spot is not physical and yet is somehow trapped in there and too stupid to take any of the many exits out, well then\u2026<br><br>if it\u2019s that dumb it may not even be worth bothering to find.<br><br>Y\u2019know?<br><br>Ok. So.<br><br>How does it happen that something so certain and so seemingly obvious is, on closer exam, not actually there?<br><br>Well, like my spot on the wall, the Self, the Me, seems real because it seems locatable. We locate, as in literally give it a solid place.<br><br>How? We describe. We compare. We monitor \u201cHow am I doing?\u201d at all times.<br><br>\u201cHow am I feeling? Was I friendly enough? Did they like me? Am I good enough? Am I smart? Oh man I\u2019m a loser, a wuss, unlovable. I am better than that person and not as good as that one.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI Am.\u201d Boom. Location.<br><br>Comparison and self-monitoring give a solidity and a sense of Spot. &nbsp;Words place us into existence.<br><br>Ok ok, fine, so who cares? Why does this even matter?<br><br>Well, actually it doesn\u2019t. Truly.<br><br>Despite all those earnest teachers and spiritual seekers\u2019 insistence, the illusion of Self doesn\u2019t ever have to be seen. No one ever has to know that they\u2019re seeing spots that aren\u2019t there.<br><br>So if you've done a lot of spiritual seeking, you can be perfectly within your rights to say, \u201cScrew it,\u201d and give that time-suck a rest at last.<br><br>Although it does feel like the Self-illusion-thingy suffers. The placement of and insistence on the existence of Spot feels awful, as lies so often do.<br><br>Which is not the worst thing in the world. Feelings of all kinds are here to be felt after all.<br><br>It's just also that ... we're not always up for those feels.<br><br>So if it seems like a break from hurting might be nice once in a while, seeing that Spot is a delusion can help some of that day to day suffering, ease.<br><br>And more ease might be ok, and could very well just be a Spot you\u2019d feel happier to see is... not there.<br><br>","extra":""}
