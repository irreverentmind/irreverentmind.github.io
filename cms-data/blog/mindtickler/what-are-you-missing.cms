For many, it feels constant, as if there\u2019s always something missing.<br><br>Love. Alcohol. Money. Sex. Satisfaction. Fun. Maybe just a sense of something\u2026 better.<br><br>Something\u2019s missing. Something.<br><br>There\u2019s wholeness somewhere, a completeness, and, well\u2026 you don\u2019t have it.<br><br>So of course it makes sense to try to fix this lack, fill this hole, by getting more complete. It\u2019s totally logical that you would try to attain money, get satisfaction or fun, achieve success, score some love or acclaim.<br><br>You might even do a million inquiries, trying to fix the messed-up, lacking individual you are so that you can be, finally, enough.<br><br>Yet somehow all that hasn\u2019t been enough either.<br><br>Because even when you get what you think is missing- when you get the love or the money or the new house or the drink- there is often still this empty sense of disappointment. Sometimes the attainment of everything you want even brings depression.<br><br>You might find yourself saying, \u201cIs that all there is?\u201d &nbsp;Which is just another way of saying, \u201cI\u2019m missing something.\u201d<br><br>Even with all your dreams met, that feeling persists.<br><br>So could it be your solutions to this sense of missing something have been misdirected?<br><br>Maybe you\u2019ve been looking for completeness in all the wrong places.<br><br>What if it's your focus on yourself, as an individual, that has confused things?<br><br>I realize that might seem like a strange question. But think about an individual wave on the ocean; if you focus on only the wave, you might miss that\u2026<br><br>It\u2019s part of, made-up of and completely an extension of, the ocean.<br><br>Something much bigger than itself.<br><br>A part of a larger whole is never going to be complete on its own.<br><br>Which is why no amount of fixing that wave, making it curl better or giving it more water, will ever make it complete.<br><br>Of course, the ocean is always right there. It only feels like it\u2019s missing, when our focus is on that one tiny wave-part.<br><br>So perhaps it's the focus on self as an individual that creates the sense of not-enough.<br><br>Maybe you feel like you're missing something because when you think you're just this Me, you are indeed missing something.<br><br>You\u2019re missing that you\u2019re not this, this individual wave. &nbsp;You're missing that connectedness to people happens even when they're not physically in the same room with you, so it's not about body or location. &nbsp;You\u2019re missing that we\u2019re all breathing the same air, thinking the same thoughts, feeling the same feelings. You're missing that we all think we\u2019re a significant speck here on this insignificant speck of rock in the great big universe. You\u2019re missing that we\u2019re all held as objects within the same space. You\u2019re missing the vast vast space that contains little ol\u2019 all of us.<br><br>Yeah. That\u2019s a whole lot of missing something.<br><br>Maybe you can begin to see how useless more love or sex or money would be.<br><br>You\u2019ve wanted to get back to wholeness. All while, seen or not, you\u2019ve<br>always been wholeness.<br><br>There\u2019s nothing to strive for, nowhere to \u201cget back\u201d to. You\u2019re already \u201cthere.\u201d<br><br>Yay! Isn\u2019t this good news? It means you\u2019re already complete. And that it\u2019s just a matter of focus, of attention, that you haven\u2019t realized it.<br><br>Nothing is missing. There\u2019s nothing to do.<br><br>So the next time a wave of, \u201cI\u2019m missing something\u201d swells up, perhaps you might play with shifting your attention to what we really are, and to noticing the connectedness, the completeness.<br><br>Maybe you don\u2019t have to focus quite so intently on the individual and what it thinks it\u2019s lacking.<br><br>Because who knows? Just that simple shift in attention might enable the exact same individual situations to feel\u2026<br><br>completely<br><br>and fully<br><br>enough.<br><br>","extra":""}
