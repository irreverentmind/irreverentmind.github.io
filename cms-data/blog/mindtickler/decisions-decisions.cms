The place sold quickly, in a bidding war, even in the heart of recession.<br><br>There was nothing but calm.<br><br>Fast forward to a few weeks later. Calm? Please.<br><br>There was crying, there was mourning, there was rethinking, regretting, revisiting.<br><br>There was redeciding.<br><br>Over and over and over and over.<br><br><em>What have I done?

Realtor was chosen, condo was prepped, cleaned, painted, listed, and sold.<br><br>And here I was, like a hamster, re-running over it all, again and again.<br><br>As if my now-panicked, now depressed review of the pros and cons mattered one whit.<br><br>As if the decision had not been already made.<br><br>Now, all these years later, I\u2019m watching various clients struggle similarly with decisions.<br><br>Decisions that have also already been made and acted on.<br><br>Take a new job? (which has already been started.) Stay with the spouse? (while not moving out for years). Keep the sick dog going? (while doing 3x daily pillings and bi-weekly trips to the vet).<br><br>There are pro-cons lists and visions of an unsalvageably messed-up future and questions about competence and confidence and worth. &nbsp;<br><br>While the body and life live out the already-finished decisions.<br><br>Finished for now, anyway. Until the idea to do something else shows up.<br><br>Such an odd thing that only humans do.<br><br>I mean, my cat gets up and walks into another room. She doesn\u2019t make the change and then think, \u201cHmmm, did I make a mistake coming in here?\u201d<br><br>And how funny that we don\u2019t notice that ideas come<em>&nbsp;TO<\/em> us.<br><br>Standing in the shower, or walking the dog, or drifting off to sleep, we are handed a gift, a surprise, an unasked-for idea.<br><br>We don\u2019t have to earn it or be deserving. Pop! There it is, coming into our heads.<br><br>From \u201cout of the blue.\u201d &nbsp;Falling into our laps. Quietly. From somewhere else.<br><br>Somewhere not driven or seen or known by us.<br><br>And then we say <em>I&nbsp;<\/em>made a decision.<em>&nbsp;I&nbsp;<\/em>did this.<br><br>Graspy humans taking ownership of something that happened to us.<br><br>And then we get busy rudely turning the gift over and over in our hands, evaluating its merits, as if it was our work and our doing and our idea and we are the arbiters of whether it\u2019s good or bad.<br><br>Like we would have any idea.<br><br>Apparently we think our participation is required. Apparently we think it\u2019s necessary to control something that came on its own and is not ours to control.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, this theft of ownership of decisions feels awful.<br><br>Hello self-blame, regret, fault and desperation to psychically figure out what the future will bring.<br><br>And we do all these mental gymnastics despite the fact that the decision itself has already come with calm. It's the ownership and rethinking and psychic guessing that brings the anxiety and worry.<br><br>It seems things run smoother and sweeter without our frantic, useless, input.<br><br>But nevermind that. Let's climb on the wheel and keep redeciding.<br><br>So the next time there\u2019s a decision needed, maybe we might try something different. Maybe we might ask, and wait, and listen, and<br><br>just follow the quiet, peaceful, popped-in suggestion.<br><br>Trusting the calm feeling to be the guide, when the inevitable doubt starts spinning.<br><br>Without questioning, without reviewing, without cross-examining and grilling the idea to death.<br><br>Kind of like trusting The Force.
