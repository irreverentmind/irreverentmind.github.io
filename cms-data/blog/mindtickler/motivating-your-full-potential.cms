We have to be the best.<br><br>Whatever that is.<br><br>Because really, what even is this full potential that we're supposed to strive for, for decades?<br><br>Is it a big house, a job title, a certain amount in the stock market? Is it a Pulitzer, an award, a medal? Is only the highest level of enlightenment acceptable?<br><br>And when, if ever, does potential finally become full and enough?<br><br>For instance, has Simone Biles achieved her Full Best?

If we surpass others, then we have achieved our best.<br><br>Meaning potential is graded on a curve, and is not actually a finite, end-goal thing in us.<br><br>It\u2019s in them. Our full potential depends on everyone else not reaching their best.<br><br>All that is needed is for everyone else not to achieve more than we do.<br><br>Yay!<br><br>And then, just to make this well-learned game even more fun,<br><br>when we don\u2019t leap off the couch eager to work work work towards some goal goal goal, to make ourselves better better better,<br><br>we and everybody else call us \u201cunmotivated.\u201d<br><br>Yes, weirdly, oddly, we\u2019re unmotivated to work all our lives, even in areas that are supposed to be fun, for a mythological best or potential that doesn\u2019t exist.<br><br>Instead, aiming for potential is so exhausting, it makes a person need a nap.<br><br>The nagging becomes a weight so heavy that we can't get off the couch.<br><br>Circularly producing exactly the result we don\u2019t want. Perpetuating self-berating and self-hatred.
