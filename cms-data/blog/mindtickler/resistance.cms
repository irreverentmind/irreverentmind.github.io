Nagging yourself to get out of the house, socialize, or cross something,&nbsp;<em>anything,<\/em>&nbsp;off the to-do list.<br><br>Trying to figure out&nbsp;<em>whyyyyy <\/em>you don\u2019t do that stuff, trying to find strategies to make yourself do it, itemizing the many supposed consequences if you don\u2019t get it right and finally behave.<br><br>Instead of noticing, for a start, that you only resist&nbsp;musts, shoulds, have-tos, and supposed obligations.<br><br>After all, everyone knows, with absolute and unquestioned certainty, what your life should properly look like, what you absolutely must do or not do, and what is Good For You.<br><br>And there\u2019s no acceptable \u201cno\u201d to What\u2019s Good For You.<br><br>And yet somehow a big, fat, not-allowed, \u201cno\u201d exists anyway.<br><br>Which no amount of resisting resistance changes into acceptance.<br><br>What a no-win conundrum.<br><br>Enter guilt, shame, self-disgust, failure, therapy, and spiritual seeking.<br><br>So let\u2019s get honest for a change. Perhaps the problem is not some deep-seated (in you, of course) issue named Resistance.<br><br>Perhaps there\u2019s not even a problem at all.<br><br>Perhaps you simply&nbsp;<em>don\u2019t want to.<\/em><br><br>You don\u2019t want to get married, cut carbs, do the taxes, fold the laundry, stop drinking. You don\u2019t want to do what the guru says, share your deepest fears with some group of total strangers, or do whatever is being asked in order to get over \u201ctrauma.\u201d<br><br>Hellooooo. You. do. not. want. to.<br><br>And then you might notice that this not-wanting-to can\u2019t be helped or controlled or stopped.<br><br>Because preferences happen <em>to<\/em> you. They\u2019re not your fault or doing.<br><br>I mean, if that power had ever been yours, you\u2018d have made your \u201cwants\u201d into something more acceptable ages ago. If you could have stopped it, you would have.<br><br>So when we say your \u201cdon\u2019t wants\u201d are a problem that it's up to you&nbsp;to fix, we\u2019re attributing far more power and control to the self&nbsp;than it actually has.<br><br>We\u2019re also saying existence is stupid and wrong.<br><br>So perhaps instead, consider renaming Resistance to the far-truer, \u201cDon\u2019t want to.\u201d<br><br>I hope you\u2019ll try this on. Because that rename comes with surprises.<br><br>That rename reveals that the same exact life you currently have, with no changes whatsoever, might be easier, lighter, freer, just by seeing that you\u2019re allowed, even encouraged by existence, to want whatever has come to you to want.<br><br>Through no fault of your own.<br><br>That rename reveals that you\u2019re allowed, even encouraged by existence, to live a life that doesn\u2019t look like everyone else\u2019s.<br><br>After all, does existence show any interest in<em> everyone <\/em>being thin, healthy, successful, social? Does existence show any interest in every human living until an energetic 95, while feeling only good feelings?<br><br>Life has different ideas, preferences, and desired outcomes than us wacky humans.<br><br>Existence might even know what it\u2019s doing.<br><br>Even when <em>what it\u2019s doing <\/em>sometimes shows up as cravings for wine, or isolation, or unhappiness and tears.<br><br>Or \u201cresistance.\u201d<br><br>Because just like acceptance and doing-things-\u201cright\u201d-according-to-humans is What Is,<br><br>Resistance is also&nbsp;<em>What Is<\/em>. Resisting resistance&nbsp;is also&nbsp;<em>What Is<\/em>.&nbsp;Don\u2019t-want-to, is also&nbsp;<em>What Is.<\/em><br><br>Just as much as acceptance or proper behavior.<br><br>Equally.<br><br>And who knows,<br><br>maybe being married to that<br><br>will turn out to be something we can accept<br><br>without resistance.
