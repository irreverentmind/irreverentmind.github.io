We\u2019re supposed to be grateful for what we have. We\u2019re supposed to like or even love ourselves. &nbsp;We\u2019re supposed to have so much well-being that it spills out into generous helpings for others.<br><br>Most of us don\u2019t come anywhere close to living up to all that.<br><br>Which is perhaps why most of us have secrets.<br><br>Let\u2019s face it, behind the polite public, \u201cI\u2019m good! How are you?\u201d we know we\u2019re not good enough.<br><br>How else to explain the ball that suddenly doesn\u2019t go over the net in competition against a lesser-ranked player? &nbsp;How else to explain the thought-it-was-ok artwork that no one is banging down the door to buy? What about the book not written, or if written not published, or if published not a best seller?<br><br>Surely others don\u2019t have this problem. &nbsp;Surely they're enough.<br><br>I mean look at those neighbors with more money, the happily married couple snuggling while we spend Valentines Day alone, all those folks not on antidepressants, the enlightened luckys sitting around peacefully enjoying their completeness while we attend yet another silent retreat.<br><br>And then there's us, hoping to catch even a whiff of the very grand something that seems to be so very missing...<br><br>In our selves.<br><br>So much pain in not being enough.<br><br>Which is kind of funny when we think about it (laughing yet?).<br><br>Because how can something that isn't there, hurt?<br><br>Hmmm. Maybe it\u2019s not the actual lack that causes pain. Maybe it\u2019s what the lack means.<br><br>Y'know, about us. As a person.<br><br>Whatever that means.<br><br>\u201cOh no, the little ball didn\u2019t go in the hole! This means I\u2019m a weak loser not-good-enough player and person.\u201d \u201cOh no, my paintings sit against the wall not earning income! This means I\u2019m an unloved non-artist who should just give up painting, and maybe even life, completely.\u201d<br><br>Oh yes it goes there. Never underestimate the mind\u2019s ability to turn everything into a referendum and absolute failure of the self.<br><br>We're obsessed with what things mean about us, what is missing in us, what is wrong with us.<br><br>And to feed that obsession we turn to situations and outcomes, asking every given happening to help us figure out our \u201ctrue nature.\u201d<br><br>So naturally outcomes like a competition score, a body-type, a house, a grand blissful experience, are what we use to tell us what we are.<br><br>Although how do we not notice that none of that is an actual person? A check is not a person, a trophy is not a person, a shape is not a person, a compliment is not a person.<br><br>These are indications of a person. Pointers to a person. They're shadows which indicate an object somewhere, but which are not the actual object.<br><br>These are hints but nothing actual.<br><br>Yet somehow we turn them into, \"This result means I AM.\"<br><br>Which as it turns out is all we've ever cared about. All we've ever wanted to do is define and prove a shadow-self which isn\u2019t there.<br><br>So perhaps it\u2019s starting to make sense why almost everyone feels less-than in some way.<br><br>We\u2019ve been right all along. This sense of self feels perpetually not good enough because it isn't good enough.<br><br>It's not real, it's not there, and it's not at all what we are. Of course it feels like lack. That's what nothing feels like.<br><br>So ok then, what do we do with this? &nbsp;<br><br>Well, rather than focus on empowerment and confidence and trying to improve results (\u201cI know I can find a way to get myself to win, dammit!\u201d),<br><br>maybe it makes more sense to play with detaching the sense of who we are from outcomes, results, and happenings.<br><br>Maybe we don't have to be quite so attached to being defined by an atta-boy, a good-hair day, an enlightenment experience.<br><br>Maybe what we are is independent of outcomes.<br><br>Even more strangely, more scandalously\u2026 maybe it doesn\u2019t even matter what we are.<br><br>Maybe whether we\u2019re good, or nice, or a winner, or even here at all...<br><br>absolutely nothing cares.<br><br>Maybe results don\u2019t matter one whit to existence.<br><br>I mean, wouldn't it be something if experience-<br><br>all experience including winning and losing and getting and not having-<br><br>All of it<br><br>turned out to be, in itself,<br><br>the point and<br><br>dare I even say\u2026<br><br>could it even be...<br><br>enough.<br><br><br><em>Click here to subscribe to get your Mind-Tickled every week. &nbsp;http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v<br>Click here to see Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&t=6s\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&amp;t=6s<\/a><\/em><br><em><img src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/f85722b0-b5fe-4970-8461-8f76fe6eda5c.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width: 26.11%;\"><\/em><br><br>","extra":""}
