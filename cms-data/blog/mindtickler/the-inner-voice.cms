Hence the absolute need to go beyond words.\" --Nisargadatta<br><\/em><br><br>----------<br><br>\u200bRecently a client told me during their session that they were silently thinking, \u201cThis is stupid, it won't work, it's a waste of time, I already know this.\u201d<br><br>Three hours later, the same person wrote to let me know that their mind was strangely quiet and they were feeling great.<br><br>Ah yes, you gotta love the mind\u2019s inner voice.<br><br>So knowledgeable.&nbsp;So sage.&nbsp;Such an expert on everything.<br><br>So imaginary.<br><br>I mean, a lot has been written elsewhere about this inner voice and what it supposedly is.<br><br>Yet we can see there\u2019s nothing provably there. Nothing with an actual voicebox, nothing which shows up on an MRI, nothing anyone but ourselves can hear.<br><br>So herewith we shall call this inner voice, \u201cHarvey,\u201d the invisible, 6-foot movie-rabbit.**<br><br>Because an inner voice which tells us regularly what\u2019s wrong with us, and&nbsp;knows everything about the past, and everything about the future&nbsp;- sure, sure, that's real.<br><br>Though it does<em> feel <\/em>real. And it's so chatty, so free with its opinions. Constantly informing us that we blew it, or we\u2019re unkind, or unloved, or crazy. Constantly informing us that there\u2019s something wrong with us, doom is coming, and there\u2019s no hope.<br><br>It\u2019s amazing we listen to it at all, considering how mean it is.<br><br>Perhaps that\u2019s partly because, right or wrong, it brings receipts. Selectively leaving out any evidence which doesn\u2019t support its theories, it says, \u201cSee? Remember when you did this, remember when you said that? See? See how they hated you? That was your doing, your fault. Because you\u2019re Cah-RA-ZEEEE.\u201d<br><br>And just like that, it sums us up.<br><br>Most folks don\u2019t notice that the inner Harvey <em>(if there is an outer Harvey please contact your doctor. That\u2019s just taking this imaginary friend business too far)<\/em> always summarizes up its bullying commentary with a definition... of who we are.<br><br>As a person.<br><br>\u201cYou\u2019re messed up.\u201d You are a weak, stupid, loser.\u201d<br><br>The \u201cme\u2019 is labeled and defined. Through Harvey.<br><br>Gosh thanks, invisible rabbit.<br><br>This is exactly what that voice is for- to&nbsp;evaluate us and identify us&nbsp;as separate, unique individuals. It makes us feel real.<br><br>It doesn\u2019t make us <em>actually<\/em> real. Just makes us<em> feel like<\/em> it.<br><br>Because of course, no not-really-there-voice can make any person actually exist.<br><br>Meanwhile, have we not noticed that this voice says the exact same things, with the exact same words, to millions, maybe even billions, of others? \u201cYou made a mistake. You should know better. You are damaged, broken, crazy. You are a bad person.\u201d<br><br>How can a voice which says the same stuff to everyone prove our own individual existence?<br><br>If those definitions of us aren\u2019t even about us in particular, then none of the name-calling is personal.<br><br>That\u2019s just Harvey reciting a script.<br><br>Which means&nbsp;it doesn't know us. It only knows its script.<br><br>Despite calling us names<em>, the voice has no idea who we are.<\/em><br><br>It gets weirder though. Because defining-us Harvey is somehow also supposed to&nbsp;<em>be<\/em>&nbsp;us. It's<em> us, <\/em>supposedly talking to ourselves.<br><br>Sure, sure, that makes sense, to be both speaker and listener, talking to our self nonstop.<br><br>And then also, that voice&nbsp;<em>belongs<\/em>&nbsp;to us. As in,&nbsp;<em>This is MY inner voice. MINE.<\/em><br><br>Though why we would want to own a pet bully, I have no idea.<br><br>So it seems we believe we are simultaneously 1) the voice, 2) the creator of the voice, 3) the thing the voice is talking&nbsp;<em>about,<\/em>&nbsp;and 4) its owner.<br><br>Which makes about as much sense as a 6-foot rabbit.<br><br>Of course there\u2019s not much we can do about this. Harvey has been talking and defining humans for thousands of years. He\u2019s not about to shut up now.<br><br>So maybe instead we could consider\u2026 If we\u2019re not whatever that bodiless voice says we are, and if we\u2019re not Harvey, and if we're not the owner of Harvey,<br><br>Who are we? What are we?<br><br>Without that voice&nbsp;defining and insisting,<br><br>Well, we... don\u2019t know.<br><br>We are dependent on Harvey to know our selves.<br><br>Luckily maybe&nbsp;we don\u2019t need to know.&nbsp;Luckily maybe we can just notice that the rabbit says its lines, and something seems to hear it.<br><br>Something is aware of it.<br><br>And whatever that is, if we just feel into it without thinking too much- is that hearer broken, flawed, crazy?<br><br>If we had to choose, which is closer to what we really are-&nbsp;Harvey or the hearer&nbsp;(if either)?<br><br>Maybe we can play with trusting that.<br><br>Without even having to know what it is.<br><br>Anymore than we currently know what the inner voice actually is.<br><br>Because Don\u2019t-know is kinder. Don\u2019t-know is un-blaming. Don\u2019t-know is open and spacious.<br><br>And paying some attention to what hears rather than what speaks,<br><br>is far more sane,<br><br>and far more peaceful,<br><br>than lugging around and feeding some mean, bullying<br><br>imaginary rabbit.<br> <br><br><br><em>** HARVEY: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Harvey_(1950_film)<\/em><br><br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here t<\/a>o subscribe and get your Mind-Tickled every week.<br><br><br><em><br>\u201cThere is a voice that doesn\u2019t use words.
