Ego is the magic that brings the dreamstate to life.\u201d<br>--Jed McKenna<br><br>----------<br><br>\"All time-<br>the past, the present, the future-<br>is contained now.\"<br>--J.

Some of those are in the \u201cdoing\/planning\/motivation\u201d category.<br><br>Confusion in this area runs high.<br><br>The questions go in two directions. The most common is, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I get up off the couch and make myself get things done?\u201d The Tickler has written about that a few times before.<br><br>Today\u2019s focus is on the other line of question, the, \u201cI know I\u2019m supposed to stay present and be good with&nbsp;<em>What Is<\/em>, but does that mean I have to abandon my life, my family, my job? What about goals, planning and action?\u201d version.<br><br>Of course, I get why there\u2019s confusion. After all, teachers have long given the idea that you\u2019re doing this spirituality thing wrong if you\u2019re concerned with the future and getting things done.<br><br><em>\"There is no use planning for a future,<br>Which when you get to it and it becomes the present, you won\u2019t be there.<br>You will be living in some other future which hasn\u2019t yet arrived.<br>And so in this way,<br>One is never able actually to inherit and enjoy<br>The fruits of one\u2019s actions.<br>You can\u2019t live at all,<br>Unless you can live fully<br>Now.\"<br>--Alan Watts<br>-----<br>\u201cDon't say: What's next?<br>Let it be a surprise.<br>A tree doesn't wonder or plan where it should grow the next leaf or when to put out the next fruit. No, its entire life is just an unfolding. You be the tree of life that is just unfolding.<br>--Mooji<br>-----<br>\u201cI&nbsp;don't have a goal. Why would I cheat myself? Why would I think so small?\u201d<br>--Byron Katie<br><\/em><br>As in, \u201cYo! You there! If you're making plans, you\u2019re focusing on the wrong thing.\u201d<br><br>Every spiritual seeker learns, <em>As it is <\/em>is where it\u2019s at.<br><br>Every spiritual seeker learns you\u2019re supposed to stay present in the moment, not be concerned&nbsp;with a future which is non-existent, and to accept or even love&nbsp;<em>What Is<\/em>&nbsp;without expectation, desire, or any need for change.<br><br>To have goals is to have your head in the \"not now.\"<br><br>So it seems fair to be confused. Because those very same teachers who preach, \u201cStay present and in the now,\u201d schedule their interviews and podcasts and guest speakers long in advance.<br><br>Aka, they plan.<br><br>I mean, even \u201cChop wood, carry water\u201d involves action. Hopefully planning to chop wood later when it isn\u2019t raining doesn\u2019t knock anyone out of their attained enlightenment.<br><br>Are you stepping off the enlightenment path if you pack a suitcase for later, aim for a promotion, decide what you\u2019ll eat later in the week when at the supermarket, or put your kid\u2019s next-month teacher conference on the calendar?<br><br>Is making an appointment not presence?<br><br>Does <em>As It Is<\/em> not include planning and action?<br><br>Does it have to be one or the other?<br><br>And the thing is, even if you were finally&nbsp;able to stay totally in the Now,&nbsp;finally able to never plan, chopping&nbsp;wood only when the presence-spirit moved you, would that actually be better?<br><br>Or would that also be Wrong?<br><br>Because don\u2019t get out of bed and don\u2019t get things done and don\u2019t get motivated, and well, everyone knows that\u2019s not ok either.<br><br>So to recap-<br><em>Do<\/em>&nbsp;and plan and have goals = wrong.<br><em>Don\u2019t Do <\/em>and don\u2019t get things done = wrong.<br><br>Yay! Equal-opportunity wrongness.<br><br>What kind of spirituality is it if no matter which way you go, you\u2019re living wrong?<br><br>So could it be possible that there\u2019s not actually a right way- one right way- to live and be present and attain, spiritually?<br><br>After all,&nbsp;<em>Do<\/em>, or <em>Don\u2019t Do<\/em>-&nbsp;both are included in&nbsp;<em>As it is.<\/em><br><br>Whatever you\u2019re moved or not moved to do, is presence.<br><br>Making plans for tomorrow, here in the present.<br>Having goals, here in the now.<br>Lying on the couch trying to force action, happening now.<br>Experiencing wishes and desires, now.<br><br>Holding lightly&nbsp;to both doing and the lack of doing.<br><br>Because&nbsp;after all, results and whatever happens later aren\u2019t up to you anyway, no matter how well you plan.<br><br>Perhaps all of the options are good.&nbsp;Since existence includes all of it.<br><br>Which means no matter what does or doesn\u2019t get done, you literally can\u2019t do this life thing, or this enlightenment thing, wrong.<br><br>Because you can\u2019t be not-present-in-the-now.<br><br>You are always present in the now.<br><br><em>\u201cYou are what you are doing RIGHT NOW!\u201d<br>--U.G.
