Krishnamurti<br><br>----------<br><br>\"Start with \"I don't know.\" Why not start where you'll end up anyway?\"<br>--Adyashanti<\/em><br><br><br>In my work, usually by the time someone becomes a client, they have already tried every therapy, every inquiry, every meditation and guru. &nbsp;Nothing has worked, and here they are still unmotivated, still anxious, still depressed, riddled with guilt, shame and regret, addicted, unable to get out of bed.<br><br>Making my weird what-the-hell-just-happened ways the end of the road for them.<br><br>Naturally these folks are desperate for something different, and lucky for us both, they\u2019re too exhausted to fight when they encounter it.<br><br>Which means new things can and do happen.<br><br>At the same time, in any moment there have always been one or two clients who spend their sessions with me fighting and refusing whatever help comes their way.<br><br>So as maybe you can imagine, I\u2019m tired.<br><br>I\u2019m tired of people begging for help and then arguing with that help when they receive it.<br><br>I\u2019m tired of the change-of-subject word \u201cbut,\u201d as in, Well yes I suppose I do feel better but.<br><br>I\u2019m tired of folks honoring and validating feelings they hate, and doing everything possible to keep their pain, because they\u2019re absolutely certain that\u2019s the right way.<br><br>I\u2019m tired of the torrents of words unendingly describing misery, instead of simple answers to simple questions.<br><br>Lovely reader, maybe you are also wanting some kind of relief and not finding it.<br><br>Maybe you are tired too.<br><br>Tired of being certain you know what\u2019s right, or what is happening or what you need to do. Tired of believing every voice that tells you who you are, what you should be, what is real, what is important.<br><br>So the question is, when is it time for Don't Know to kick in?<br><br>I mean, everyone knows an open mind is needed for new info to enter. Nothing can enter a closed door.<br><br>When do you give up, when do you give in, when do you surrender to knowing absolutely nothing?<br><br>That would be different, wouldn\u2019t it?<br><br>\u201dI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m right about me or others or politics or climate change. I don\u2019t know if this is a bad feeling, even though I think it is. I don\u2019t know if there is a self or free will or death. I don\u2019t know what consciousness is, I don\u2019t know what I am, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s true, I don\u2019t know what should happen.<br><br>I don\u2019t know anything. I am willing to find out.\u201d<br><br>Maybe you can feel a bit of spaciousness, a little bit of sigh, just from reading these words.<br><br>Because really there\u2019s only one way to get some space between yourself and feelings you don\u2019t want, yourself and tormenting thoughts, your self and enlightenment (whatever that might be for you.)<br><br>And that\u2019s an open mind.<br><br>Yet oddly,&nbsp;Don't Know&nbsp;might be the one thing you haven\u2019t tried.<br><br>Ever wonder why not? After all, it seems simple enough, right? What\u2019s the big deal in being willing to not know?<br><br>Well let\u2019s face it, once that door is opened, who knows what will slip out and be lost forever.<br><br>Loosen the grip on being certain and, who or what are you? What\u2019s left, without, \u201cI know?\u201d<br><br>That open escape route might lead to discovering just how gauzy this self-thing actually is.<br><br>Maybe it's better&nbsp;to suffer for a lifetime than consider that everything you know about yourself, I mean&nbsp;everything-&nbsp;your life, your body, your nature, your history- has been fiction.<br><br>Apparently the sense of self, the sense of who you are, would rather be sure of things and hurt, than to give in to uncertainty, know nothing, and feel better.<br><br>In which case, thoughts like,&nbsp;I already know this, this is wrong, this won\u2019t work,do the job nicely.<br><br>As do miserable feelings like depression, anxiety, and shame.<br><br>They protect the self from possible disolution.<br><br>Luckily all of that is just more certainty.<br><br>Luckily all of that can be answered with&nbsp;Don't Know.<br><br>So am I right about any of this? I don\u2019t know.<br><br>Is there anything of value even when there\u2019s a closed stuck door and lots of pain? I don\u2019t know.<br><br>Am I tired? I don\u2019t know.<br><br>Do I know anything about anything? I don\u2019t know.<br><br>And with that, a door opens.<br><br>And something breathes.<br><br>Something relaxes.<br><br>Something lets go.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Don\u2019t know.<br><br><br><em>\"In the end, nobody can let go of the cliff for us.
