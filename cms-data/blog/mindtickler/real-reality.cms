I\u2019m looking right at it.\u201d<br><br>Yes, everyone knows there are actual things out there, right? Tree, car, house, other people. Real you, sitting at real desk, looking at real screen.

Everyone knows this.<br><br>So let\u2019s take a moment to notice<em>&nbsp;how<\/em> this is known.<br><br>You know there\u2019s a tree because you- <em>you<\/em>- can see it. You can touch it. You can hear it.<br><br>Color and shape is happening in your personal eyeballs, sensation is happening in your personal fingertips, sound is happening in your personal ears.<br><br>You can know with certainty that objects exist because your own senses say so.<br><br>Although that makes whatever is perceived, personal to you. That\u2019s your sky, your tree, your red or blue or green.<br><br>Right there, in your body, literally within your own sensory apparatus.<br><br>And there\u2019s no way to know or confirm if your reality, and your tree, is the same as anyone else\u2019s.
