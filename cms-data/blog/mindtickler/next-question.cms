But my opinions and judgments are no more important than the opinions and judgments of your mother or that taxi driver there.\"<br>--UG. Krishnamurti<br>--------<br><br>\u201cGet two spiritual leaders in a room and you\u2019ll never see so much smoke being blown up each other\u2019s asses. That\u2019s how they levitate.\u201d \u2013Aaron Joy<\/em><br><br>------------<br><br>The flattering stranger writes and asks me a spiritual-type question. It\u2019s a question about consciousness, awareness, truth, and of course how to get some of that for himself. &nbsp;<br><br>Y\u2019know, the usual.<br><br>He\u2019s looking for understanding, freedom, guidance. He wants to \u201cget it.\u201d He\u2019s looking to be shown the way. He\u2019s looking for magic in an email.<br><br>From me.<br><br>Aw mister, don\u2019t you know I have been disappointing people all my life?<br><br>I mean just ask my mother who, though dead, will no doubt drop down from the heavens just to let you know to about my lack of brag-worthy achievements, lack of adequate bank account, lack of necessary beauty, lack of proper personality.<br><br>But ok fine, here is this man turning to me as if I can give him something. And though I truly suck at being what people want me to be,<br><br>I\u2019m nothing if not polite (cough),<br><br>So I do my best to reply. I send a short couple of sentences, consisting mostly of questions turned back to the asker, hoping to intrigue him to ponder.<br><br>There! My best attempt at giving him what he wants. He\u2019s probably not going to recognize it.<br><br>And sure enough, 2 weeks later there\u2019s the same guy with the same question, this time on social media asking someone far sager than I. Someone who, after replying with a somewhat repetitious 15 or 20 lonnngg paragraphs added to my couple of sentences, provides all the answer \u2013and then some- that any inquirer could possibly ask for.<br><br>Surely now question-guy is filled up with satisfying truth and understanding.<br><br>Nope. Turns out question-man enjoys that kind of response very much. He reposts, adds multiple lengthy comments, revels in the windy word count, soaking up all those little letters.<br><br>And then... he asks a whole bunch more questions of Answer Sage.<br><br>Seems no matter how many posts, discussions, questions, answers, satsangs, podcasts, meditations, there are always still more questions.<br><br>Perhaps because questions are a bottom-less pit of never get there.<br><br>Perhaps because someone else\u2019s answers don\u2019t actually answer anything.<br><br>Perhaps because the sage\u2019s position is not the same as the asker\u2019s position.<br><br>Since that is literally impossible.<br><br>So then the question becomes, should anyone- Rupert, Adya, Grand-Windy-Sage, anyone- actually answer these queries? Ever?<br><br>After all, if what is wanted is experiential understanding, what good does some teacher's understanding do for the inquirer?<br><br>Words can not create experience, they can only describe it. That's not what is being sought by this kind of asking.<br><br>Could it be that depending on Teacher to tell how things are, how Teacher sees things, what happened to Teacher in the past to make that magic happen,<br><br>actually encourages any asker to be dissatisfied with his own answers?<br><br>If he even looks for them at all.<br><br>Because having all these resources and lengthy answers to every question might just make a person not even bother asking himself.<br><br>Could it be all this turning to sages ensures seekers don't find their way?<br><br>Hmmm.<br><br>Maybe if teachers really want to help, they might tell questioners they\u2019ll be chasing forever this way,<br><br>And then, just shut up.<br><br>So that there might be even a moment of silence for the asker to hear his own answers without all the bloviating noise.<br><br>Yeah that would be different.<br><br>But it\u2019s not to be. Because this cuts right to the heart of most teachers\u2019 income and follower base.<br><br>After all, if people don\u2019t seek sages' wisdom and give them an opportunity to spew their views, what exactly do sages have to offer? Why would they keep talking? What needs that unending word spouting?<br><br>Surprise! Turns out all those long-winded answers not only fill up askers with wind, they fill up the teachers too.<br><br>Sages get to be someone who knows something, someone who has something, someone who generously offers to others who don\u2019t have what they have.<br><br>Which is just an exaltation of the ego.<br><br>Questions and answers validate both selves- asker and answerer.<br><br>Kind of the opposite of what people imagine teachers are doing.<br><br>Now this isn't to stop the questions from being asked. I realize it feels like they must be asked.<br><br>It's just that it's clear, most folks adore this idea of pretending to seek, while actually<br><br>intending never to find.<br><br>So though I will never be able to give the actual experience inquirers say they want,<br><br>and truly no one- no guru, no wise one, no enlightened sage- ever will either\u2026<br><br>Still, when asked, I\u2019m willing and happy to keep offering less.<br><br>Less pretending, less superiority, less words, less answers, less stringing-along, less\u2026more.<br><br>Oh yes, there\u2019s plenty more where that less came from.<br><br>Everyone is welcome to ask for more of that.<br><br>Anytime.<br><br>And I also wish for all askers<br><br>to enjoy living<br><br>Without getting it.<br><br>Which is as rich and enlightened as anyone could ever get.<br><br>And who knows, might even<br><br>answer<br><br>every question.<br><br><br><br>Click here to subscribe to get your Mind-Tickled every week. &nbsp;http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v<br>Click here to see Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump. &nbsp; &nbsp;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&amp;t=6s<br><br><br>\"<em>When you are deluded and full of doubt, even a thousand books of scripture are not enough.
