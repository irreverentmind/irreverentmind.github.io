She read me a very long psalm from right there on her phone, trying earnestly to help me understand her world.<br><br>Feeling touched by her generosity, in return I gifted her with the information that we (she and I) don\u2019t exist. And not having a psalm, instead I offered her a way to see this for herself.<br><br>Yes indeedy.<br><br>That went over exactly as well as you might imagine.<br><br>Since my friend wasn't too excited about the gift I held out for her, I thought maybe you might want it.<br><br>Who knows, maybe you'll enjoy it better.<br><br>So start by thinking of a big emotion you don\u2019t like. Anger maybe, or sadness, despair, anxiety, jealousy, humiliation.<br><br>Something intense.<br><br>Got it? Ok, so here\u2019s the question:<br><br>That feeling\u2026 what if that\u2019s what you are?<br><br>Like, literally.<br><br>As in, \u201cI am literally this feeling.\u201d<br><br>Not the one feeling it.<br><br>Not what's aware of it either.<br><br>What if what you are is the feeling itself?<br><br>Now usually, right about now, the mind diverts to figuring out if you agree.<br><br>Or pivots to brushing away the question with, \u201cYeah yeah I know this already.\"<br><br>Which is all fine; it just may keep you from receiving your gift.<br><br>So set that aside, because it doesn\u2019t matter if you already know or if you agree, and come back.<br><br>Just see if it\u2019s possible to slip into that feeling and try on,<br><br>BEing it.<br><br>BE the sensations.<br><br>Be the thoughts about the feeling too.<br><br>Even BE the thoughts about this stupid question your friendly Mind-Tickler is making a big deal of, and about whatever other things passing through.<br><br>Being all of it.<br><br>What if all that experience- &nbsp;this feeling, then that thought, then that one, and that one and that sound and those colors-<br><br>is what you are?<br><br>Can you see how decentralized that makes you, almost instantly?<br><br>How that usual, always-there, strong \u201csense\u201d of self just...dissipates\u2026<br><br>when there\u2019s no feeler, no witnesser, no owner, no controller\u2026<br><br>No -er of any kind\u2026<br><br>when there\u2019s just experience, happening?<br><br>Because if you are experience itself rather than The One doing the experiencing or The Witness who\u2019s aware of the experience\u2026<br><br>where exactly is this 'you'?<br><br>You is unlocatable. You is center-less. You is everywhere.<br><br>Perhaps there\u2019s freedom in this.<br><br>Perhaps the usual responsible and centered sense of self has felt so solid all this time because the wrong questions have been asked.<br><br>All this time, thought has insisted you\u2019re the one who's asking and you\u2019re the one who's answering and you\u2019re the one who's experiencing.<br><br>When maybe instead, all along, you\u2019ve been the experience itself.<br><br>Fluid. Fleeting. Present in the extreme. Not a thing. Not solid. Not there.<br><br>Not anywhere.<br><br>And then you might notice what happens to intense feeling or anything else when it's seen that you are it,<br><br>rather than a you who\u2019s supposedly feeling something.<br><br>That might be a whole different experience to BE.<br><br>Maybe not so urgent. Maybe not so important. Maybe not so wrong. Maybe not so real.<br><br>Which coincidentally is something a lot of folks reading The Mind-Tickler happen to want\u2026<br><br>Either to feel better, or to truly understand that there is no you, or to be consciousness- the screen, rather than the show on the screen.<br><br>Hence, my gift to you.<br><br>And though of course this may all seem very weird,<br><br>And may bring up your disapproval or disagreement,<br><br>I hope you can play with it a little anyway.<br><br>Because wouldn't it be wonderful to actually get what you want for a change.<br><br>Even if it comes in an un-gift-wrapped, decentralized, no-center kind of gift box.<br><br>Which you also<br><br>get to Be.<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Click here to get your Mind-Tickled via email every week.<\/strong><\/em><\/a><strong><em><br><\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&t=6s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Click here to watch Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump<\/strong><\/em><\/a><br><br><br><em>\u201cThe experience is of consciousness experiencing itself.\"<br>\u2013Nisargadatta<br><br>----------<br><br>\"When I was young<br>I looked at a lampshade<br>And saw God.<br>\"The lampshade is God,\" I said.<br>My parents, good people, said<br>\"Perhaps God is in the lampshade, but God is not the lampshade.\"<br>But I knew that God<br>Was the lampshade,<br>And the lamp,<br>And the table beneath the lamp,<br>And everything else.<br>And in the moment I said so, I knew who I was.\"<br>--Bruce Nygren<br><\/em><br><img src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/ed299b2f-090c-fc53-9afe-366b229a4cf8.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width: 25.13%;\">","extra":""}
