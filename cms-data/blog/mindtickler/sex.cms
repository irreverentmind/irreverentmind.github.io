Or something.<br><br>It's not about the dark. Dark is bad. Dark is wrong.<br><br>Don\u2019t be talking about down and dirty naughty filthy sex.<br><br>This is taboo territory.<br><br>So many judgments, so many evaluations- right wrong, good bad, naughty nice, normal perverted, should shouldn\u2019t.<br><br>So much we\u2019re not allowed to do.<br><br>So much hidden and kept to ourselves.<br><br>So many secrets.<br><br>Ever wonder why?<br><br>What are we so afraid of, that sex has to be restricted, monitored, hidden and driven underground?<br><br>We might start by noticing the existence of all the monitoring, the self evaluations, the \u201cHow\u2019m I doing\u201d and \u201cDo I like this\u201d and \u201cDo they like this\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m such a stud\u201d and \u201cCan I do this\u201d going on.<br><br>And we might notice that we\u2019re supposed to perform well, to be good at it, to last a long time, to take care of ourselves and the other (if we\u2019re lucky enough to not be playing alone).<br><br>And don\u2019t forget we have to look good doing it. \u201cDo I look fat in this position? Does s\/he think I\u2019m hot? Look how big I am!\u201d<br><br>And normal-we have to appear normal, not too weird.<br><br>Or we have to appear wild and crazy and not anywhere near normal.<br><br>But we have to appear as something.<br><br>Yikes.<br><br>That\u2019s a lot of requirements, isn\u2019t it?<br><br>A lot of self-monitoring and self-evaluation and self-identifying happening.<br><br>It\u2019s a miracle we get it on at all, with so much mental activity.<br><br>Most of which we hide. We\u2019re not sharing almost any of this with others.<br><br>Because it\u2019s the ultimate in personal.<br><br>It\u2019s person-al.<br><br>There\u2019s identity-making happening.<br><br>There\u2019s person-making happening.<br><br>\u201cI am loved, sexy, wild, wanted, free spirited, daring, uncontrolled. I am a stud, a conqueror, a bad boy, a good girl, a victim, a weak-willied failure, a hot tamale.\u201d<br><br>Whatever the particulars, I am-ing is happening.<br><br>We see ourselves based on image making with our partners.<br><br>We see ourselves.<br><br>Although as a person-making process, does it work?<br><br>Does thinking \u201cI am a hot babe\u201d actually make one a hot babe?<br><br>Does it make one\u2026 anything at all?<br><br>Are we any more real just because we think I AM?<br><br>Does the existence of thoughts that say \u201cI am...\u201d prove the existence of Self?<br><br>Nah. That\u2019s like saying \u201cSee this idea of a fork? You can eat with this.\u201d<br><br>It\u2019s a description of a fork.<br><br>It\u2019s a description of a self.<br><br>That\u2019s not the self.<br><br>They\u2019re not the same thing.<br><br>So with sex here\u2019s this very physical act that would seem to be the ultimate way to prove the very obvious \"Duh\" existence of Me- the Self.<br><br>But it doesn't work.<br><br>So it could be that all the hiding, acting-out and fantasies are just designed to serve in our Self-story-creation.<br><br>To enable a sense of person.<br><br>Even though they fail to create an actual person.<br><br>Which is perhaps exactly what we\u2019re hiding; what we\u2019re so deeply ashamed of.<br><br>Perhaps this is the big secret we keep hidden in the dark, and the reason so much about sex is taboo.<br><br>So that we can make sure that that failure, that non-proof of a Self despite our very best physical efforts, doesn\u2019t get seen.<br><br>Because is a non-existent-self sexy or a stud or hot?<br><br>How could it be? What would want sex?<br><br>No, we don\u2019t want to go there. And if it\u2019s taboo we don\u2019t have to.<br><br>\u201cShhhh. There\u2019s nobody here. But let\u2019s pretend we\u2019re something and have naughty sex!\u201d<br><br>Which is kind of a shame when you think about it. And ironic really.<br><br>Because sex might be a hell of a lot more fun if it didn\u2019t have to carry the burden of our entire personhood on its back.<br><br>And it could be that by setting aside all that I-am-ing for a bit, sex might even turn out to be quite a potent portal, a doorway, into seeing through the illusion of self.<br><br>Enlightenment via orgasm.<br><br>Now that\u2019s hot.<br>","extra":""}
