They speak about: there is no doer, no thinker, no knower, etc. What are they talking about? What does it all mean? &nbsp;Is everything spontaneous then?

If you don\u2019t, that\u2019s on you. &nbsp;<br><br>So of course after my mis-swallow, God, the universe, karma, Zeus, Yama -all sitting in some celestial pub making up rules for humans and meting out consequences \u2013 stepped in to provide the coughing punishment I deserved.<br><br>Because it seems humans have the power and control to cause bad things, aka be at fault,<br><br>but then somehow don't have the power and control to sidestep the results.<br><br>This is what we call \u201cresponsibility.\u201d<br><br>We're in charge of success or failure, money in the bank, getting a hole in one, painting a masterpiece, writing brilliantly, the temperature of the planet, and whether polar bears go extinct.<br><br>We\u2019re in charge of how we feel and what we think and whether we judge or compare or dislike. We\u2019re even in charge of how \u201cwe make\u201d other people feel and think too.<br><br>All happenings placed squarely on the me. I did this.<br><br>That\u2019s how it works. &nbsp;I don\u2019t make the rules.<br><br>Cause and effect is completely built-in to the sense of self. Everything is about the Me and what it did and what it caused and what it deserves.<br><br>We\u2019ll even make up dots to connect if we have to, as long as we\u2019re the center point and cause of what happens.<br><br>Although we might notice how heavy all that fault, blame, responsibility, free will and doership are.<br><br>It\u2019s heavy heavy stuff.<br><br>Which it really needs to be. Since heaviness keeps us from noticing how wispy the self actually is.<br><br>The substantialness of the self is enhanced by heaviness.<br><br>Sigh.

What if experience is new every second and has no prior cause or reason?<br><br>Of course no one has to believe any of this. It\u2019s just a point of view and a \u201cwhat if.\" No harm in trying it on.<br><br>And it just may be worth playing with.

The eyes see but you say, \"I see\". The nose smells, but you say, \"I smell\". All this is the power of the Self and yet you say, \"I did it\". That power belongs to God. Who is this ego arrogating 'I'? He has no place in the palace, but once admitted inside, he overrules the king and affirms his own existence. But after some enquiry, this ego's existence is easily disproved. Then the king once again affirms, \"I am Reality.\" There is one thing about this condition \u2013 there is bliss.
