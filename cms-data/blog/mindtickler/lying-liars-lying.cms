And yet everyone does.","words":737,"content":"One of my family members used to pride themselves on never lying. This was ridiculous of course, because of course they did lie sometimes.<br><br>Everyone does.<br><br>Someone says, \u201cHow are you today?\u201d and we say, \u201cGood!\u201d when just moments ago we were curled in a ball sobbing and wishing for the mercy of death.<br><br>And yet from the earliest age it\u2019s made clear that lying is bad and one mustn\u2019t do it.<br><br>So breaking this down\u2026 here is a behavior no one is ever supposed to do, and everyone does it anyway, and then occasionally everyone gets pissed-off about it.<br><br>What a weird game.<br><br>Ever wonder what's up with that? Ever wonder why lies are so infuriating, and why, if no one is supposed to lie, everyone does it?<br><br>It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that these individual characters themselves are a lie to begin with, could it? &nbsp;After all, we\u2019re not what we say we are.<br><br>Yes we deny knowing this, and yes we pretend to be confused by such statements.<br><br>But know it, we do.<br><br>How do we know we know?<br><br>Well for one thing, we call these lives of ours, \u201cstories,\u201d for a reason. We play our roles, act like ourselves, set the scene, indulge in drama, tell our tales.<br><br>Hidden in plain sight right in everyday language is plenty of proof that we know this reality thing is made up. That the whole deal is a lie. An everybody-agrees fiction.<br><br>As if all of us have gotten together in the middle of the night to conspire and agree to pretend it ain\u2019t so.<br><br>And then there are rules to maintain that fiction, supposedly for the benefit of all.<br><br>And one of those rules is, \u201cThou shalt not lie.\u201d &nbsp;As in, \"Thou shalt not expose this pretense.\"<br><br>Even though we\u2019re lying every minute. &nbsp;And even though we have to, if we're going to protect and continue the idea that we are these individuals. &nbsp;<br><br>And then along comes some blatant showman who says, \u201cHaha! I\u2019m not playing by those rules. I\u2019m going to make stuff up and not even hide it.\u201d<br><br>And the rest of us are not amused.<br><br>Because liars show us that our point of view is flimsy. They show how malleable \u201ctruth\u201d is, and how made-up these versions of reality are. Lying breaks the tacit agreement about how to present the scene.<br><br>Oh this makes us mad. &nbsp;After all, if we're going to play by the cover-up rules, dammit, they better too. What good is it for us to pretend to be an individual if others are not going to play along?<br><br>Which is why so many of us feel foolish when someone lies to us outright. We feel exposed, tricked, done wrong.<br><br>The Prime Directive is that the lovely filmy Truth-dream must never be betrayed. And instead, liars show us that the veil is gauzy.<br><br>Now of course, I\u2019m not saying, \u201cYay! Lies!\u201d But when we begin to see how made-up reality is, perhaps we might be able to admire a certain amount of... creativity. After all, we can make it anything.<br><br>Like my family member, who has stopped lying about lying and now just falsifies outright like a dang baller.<br><br>We get to watch reality be reimagined.<br><br>It\u2019s wild how liberating the honesty of knowing we are a lie can be.<br><br>And really, once it\u2019s seen that none of this is True, why not go all out? Why not Donald-Trump our way right into freedom? Break out of the box once in a while, and like any painter or artist...<br><br>Simply make that sh*t up?<br><br>Reality is here for our invention.<br><br>We may as well have some fun with it.<br><br>Because whatever is \"real,\" if anything, will continue no matter what words come out of humans' mouths.<br><br>And it certainly won't mind our tall tales.<br><br><br>Click to get in on the Mind-Tickler every week","extra":""}
