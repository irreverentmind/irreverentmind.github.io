I mean, ew.<br><br>So it probably doesn't make sense to spend hours and hours examining the contents of this basket, analyzing what made this smell, what made that stain, and then trying to change each piece into spun gold or a zen garden or whatnot.<br><br>There doesn't seem to be any advantage in that kind of busy-work.<br><br>And then, maybe it's also ok not to spend a lot of time focused on any one particular piece in the basket. I mean, not much point zeroing in on any one sock or unmentionable, is there?<br><br>After all, it\u2019s just a pile of laundry.<br><br>It can\u2019t bite, kick, or laugh at you. It can\u2019t torture you or leap out of the basket when your attention is elsewhere.<br><br>It sits there inanimate, harmless, minding its own business.<br><br>It has no power.<br><br>And now take a look inside the basket.

What\u2019s outside the basket, still seeing it?<br><br>Whatever that is, which is more likely to be what you are? Dirty pants, or whatever knows that pants are in the basket? &nbsp;<br><br>Now of course you may not be what knows, either.<br><br>But you\u2019re no sock, that much is clear.<br><br>Because you can't be both the thing that\u2019s seen and the thing that sees it.<br><br>Yes, a case can be made that you are indeed both, or even, neither.<br><br>And certainly The Mind-Tickler has made many such cases, many times.<br><br>But today we\u2019re playing with a less-dogmatic<br><br>middle way.<br><br>A practical and integrate-able way into everyday life which provides some relief and clarity.<br><br>Even if it\u2019s not the be-all, end-all, only way.<br><br>Because thoughts and feelings in a laundry basket are not you.<br><br>In which case, the next time life feels really challenging, there\u2019s no harm in getting a little distance from the wash.<br><br>There\u2019s no harm in putting difficult thoughts and feelings all into a heap, stepping back, taking a look at the collective pile,<br><br>And then noticing that you-<br><br>whatever that even is-<br><br>are looking at the pile.<br><br>Aware of the pile.<br><br>Not the pile.<br><br>Now of course no one ever has to do this.<br><br>It\u2019s just that getting a little distance from stinky basket stuff feels pretty good.<br><br>It feels sane, and so much better, to get a little space from the wacky notion that what you are is a thought\/feeling sock.<br><br>Because less identification with crazy is a wonderful thing.<br><br>Feels pretty good.<br><br>Something knows this. &nbsp;<br><br>And it\u2019s not the laundry.<br><br><br><em><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled via email every week<\/a>.<br><\/strong><\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&t=6s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Click here to watch Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump<\/strong><\/em><\/a><br><br><em>\u201cNobody told us that what we are is a point of awareness. This isn\u2019t something we\u2019re taught. Rather, we were taught to identify with our name. We were taught to identify with our birth date. We were taught to identify with the next thought that we have. We were taught to identify with all the memories our mind collects about the past. But all that was just more thinking. When you stand in your own authority, you meet that ultimate mystery that you are. Even though it may be at first unsettling to look into your own no-thingness, you do it anyway. Why? Because you no longer want to suffer. Because you\u2019re willing to be amazed. You\u2019re willing to be surprised. You\u2019re willing to realize that maybe everything you\u2019ve ever thought about yourself really isn\u2019t true.\u201d<br>--Adyashanti<\/em><br><br><em><img src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/782911dc-316f-6621-176b-34dd0ef2f131.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width: 31.82%;\"><\/em><em><strong><br><\/strong><\/em>","extra":""}
