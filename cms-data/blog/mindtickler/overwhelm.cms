Bring your friend-thoughts, \u201cToo much! Can\u2019t handle! Can\u2019t do it all!\u201d Also a big howdy to your companions panic, anxiety, self-disgust, and action-paralysis too.<br><br>Plan, clean, cook, bake, buy, wrap. Arrange travel, parties, family dinners, and obligatory socializing.<br><br>And be joyous about all of it, dammit.<br><br>Yes, it\u2019s over the top with whelm.<br><br>A word that means the exact same thing as overwhelm.<br><br>Because at this fine time of the year, why not use two words to say what one word can, making that one word longer and extra-intense for no reason other than to increase drama.<br><br>Much like our To-do List.<br><br>So call it overwhelm, as in&nbsp;engulf, drown, overrun, overcome, crush.<br><br>And then pretend there\u2019s a legit danger that we can indeed literally be crushed by words, petty tasks, and hope-to-do-\u2018ems.<br><br>The self, vanquished. Overcome. Undone.<br><br>By chores.<br><br>Oh noooooooooo.<br><br>Fragile little thing, eh?<br><br>I mean, you\u2019d think that all those years spent&nbsp;propping up the image&nbsp;as we like it, building that self-thingy up, doing our best to believe that it\u2019s us, would cushion and protect us.<br><br>But instead&nbsp;there\u2019s frantic panic about&nbsp;the sense of self disappearing under the weight of&nbsp;The List.&nbsp;All that carefully&nbsp;cultivated self-control, the well-planned management of the future, just... disintegrating.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>The bad feeling starts to make sense.<br><br>So for a bit of relief, let\u2019s notice first that overwhelm is just a feeling and a small handful of thoughts. Both of which we\u2019re experts at experiencing.<br><br>Nothing we can\u2019t handle there.<br><br>And then shockingly, we might also notice that nothing on The List actually needs to be done. At all.<br><br>Yes we think we want to, yes we think we <em>have <\/em>to.<br><br>But in actuality, none of it is necessary.<br><br>You know how we can know this? Because&nbsp;year after year,&nbsp;The List doesn\u2019t get completed, there are always lots of things still left to do, and yet life goes on just fine.<br><br>So now, right about here, thought may trot out the notion of consequences and a painful future.<br><br>\u201cThe holidays won\u2019t be joyous.\u201d<br><br>Fine. Is overwhelm joyous? Surely nothing makes your family happier than seeing you drown in petty to-dos.<br><br>Or- \u201cThe kids will be sad and hate me, there won\u2019t be any food, it will be a terrible holiday. This is not how it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d<br><br>Like humans know how things are supposed to be. Sure,&nbsp;reality proves us wrong over and over, but never mind.<br><br>And let\u2019s not forget what it means, about us, as a person, if we don't do all the important things on The List.<br><br>\u201cNo presents&nbsp;means I\u2019m a bad parent.&nbsp;No parties&nbsp;means I\u2019m unlovable.&nbsp;No family dinner&nbsp;means I\u2019m weird, damaged, alone.\u201d<br><br>As if the self-&nbsp;who we are- is defined by whether we go to a party or get the kids a toy.<br><br>That\u2019s a whole lot of self-identity going on there, under the supposed guise of overwhelm.<br><br>So is your friendly Mind-Tickler saying don\u2019t do anything at holiday time?<br><br>Nah, lots of things get done regardless. I mean, try&nbsp;not&nbsp;doing them. The body gets up off the couch for some things anyway.<br><br>So maybe it\u2019s possible to play with holding The List lightly.<br><br>Noticing what we really want to happen vs. what would be nice but not worth the cost of panic.<br><br>It could turn out that we and our families have more fun and are happier when we are not stressed to the max.<br><br>We might chance doing less. Even only to find out if the self does indeed vanish or if it carries on, regardless of what gets done.<br><br>Because who knows? A vanished self might turn out to bring its own gifts-<br><br>gifts that might not be wrapped, or on The List at all-<br><br>maybe even a joy,<br><br>which could turn out to be<br><br>overwhelming.<br>\u200b<br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/strong><\/a><br> <br><br>","extra":"","extra2":""}
