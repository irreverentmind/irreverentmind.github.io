As in,&nbsp;what&nbsp;can be done about them.<br><br>Every good spiritual seeker knows that thoughts are bad, n\u2019kay?<br><br>We\u2019re at war with thinking. Apparently it\u2019s a powerful enemy we mustn\u2019t allow to live.<br><br>Apparently it\u2019s not enough that humans try to control absolutely everything in these lives- love, safety, health, feelings, money, time, productivity, desires, future.<br><br>No, we shall master thought too- ours and other people\u2019s. (We don\u2019t want others thinking the wrong thoughts about us, do we?)<br><br>Thinking does not get a pass.<br><br>Thought-management is required for&nbsp;enlightened self-less clear transcendence.<br><br>So ideally, the goal is to stop rumination completely. Eradication is highly preferred. Find a way to shut those babies down into complete mental silence.<br><br>Although try attaining realization, understanding, or \u201cgetting it,\u201d without thinking.<br><br>In fact, try living&nbsp;in any way&nbsp;without thoughts. Try raising kids, working, planning dinner, or listening to some teacher on you-tube, without thoughts.<br><br>We can\u2019t have one without all of it.<br><br>Ok fine, then stretch thoughts out so that there\u2019s lots more calm zoned-out empty space in-between thoughts.<br><br>Or, if that can\u2019t be done either, then for goodness\u2019 sake at least find ways to not believe them. And reroute thoughts so they go somewhere more to our liking.<br><br>Ok, let's take a moment and rethink this.<br><br>Because&nbsp;guess who it\u2019s up to, to make all that happen?<br><br>That would be us.<br><br>It\u2019s us who must wrestle thinking into line, whether through meditation or inquiry or psychedelics.<br><br>It\u2019s us who must control something that has been around for millennia, minding its own business, trying to force it to take us where&nbsp;we&nbsp;want to go, rather than where&nbsp;it&nbsp;wants.<br><br>Yep, it's all-powerful humans who will surely harness and put a leash on that.<br><br>Hmmm. Perhaps right about here, it's worth noticing&nbsp;what&nbsp;wants thought gone in the first place.<br><br>Because that would be... thought. What says thought is a problem? Thought.<br><br>Thought says, \u201cI\u2019m a very bad thing, I stand between you and contentment, so I need to make my very own self vanish forever.\u201d<br><br>It wants to be rid of itself?&nbsp;Um, OK.<br><br>And the thing is, what for? Just so that we can score some blissful feeling we happen to like?<br><br>Maybe all we need is just different thoughts. Nicer thoughts. More positive thoughts. Fewer of them. Thoughts that take us where&nbsp;we&nbsp;want to go.<br><br>\u2018Course, we are not in charge of any of that.<br><br>Not to mention that consciousness has no problem with any of this. After all, human thinking is It too.<br><br>That means it doesn\u2019t matter if thoughts exist, if they\u2019re something or nothing, if they say things we like or don\u2019t, if they bring a feeling we like or don\u2019t.<br><br>So maybe we can leave the management of thinking to whatever owns it, and let go of that misguided battle.<br><br>Maybe instead of trying to turn&nbsp;What Is&nbsp;into our limited version of \u201cbetter\u201d by willful control,<br><br>Maybe instead of adding extra thoughts about managing thinking to the pile of thoughts we are supposedly trying to reduce,<br><br>we can just make peace with it, as it is.<br><br>Because fighting for control of something much much bigger than we'll ever be, seems an odd way to seek peace, bliss, or enlightenment.<br><br>Whereas watching thinking come, watching it be liked or disliked, watching it float off and be replaced by the next, is easier. More inclusive. Less at-fault. Calmer. More peaceful.<br><br>And that just might turn out to be a whole lot closer to<br><br>what we wanted to get<br><br>by controlling thoughts<br><br>to begin with.<br><br><br><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/a><\/strong><br>&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td valign=\"top\"><table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td><table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td valign=\"top\"><em>\"You can\u2019t empty your mind of thoughts.
