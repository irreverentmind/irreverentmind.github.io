What do you think will die? What?\u201c<br>--UG Krishnamurti<br><\/em><br><br>The young boy wants to talk about death. Specifically what happens after we die.<br><br>Of course, typically young folks are not yet concerned with this subject. But it turns out this boy\u2019s grandfather was admitted to the hospital over the weekend, and he\u2019s scared and trying to process and figure things out.<br><br>Just like every other person who's ever been born.<br><br>Humans have been concerned with what happens after death from time immemorial.<br><br>We have questions.<br><br>Do we go somewhere? Do we linger in some in-between place for a while, or maybe forever? Can we communicate? Do we come back? If so, will we remember the Me as we currently know it? What happens to our own timeline, our pets, our life, our story? Is death the end of me?<br><br>It does seem pretty clear, at least, that the body dies, taking the story of me with it.<br><br>We are dismayed. We want reassurance.<br><br>So we ask around.<br><br>The problem is, the only people that can be asked are not dead. Their answers cannot come from experience.<br><br>Which means they are guessing.<br><br>No matter how absolutely certain thinkers and philosophers may sound as they discuss heaven, hell, nothingness, or dust- still, they can only imagine. They can only theorize.<br><br>Which are words synonymous with, \u201cmaking stuff up.\u201d<br><br>Religious and spiritual leaders, ghost-hunters, s\u00e9ance-holders, pragmatists who say nothing comes afterwards but worms \u2013 none of them have been there.<br><br>Even for people with near-death experiences- the key word is \u201cnear.\u201d If they are here to answer questions and write books, they are not dead.<br><br>None of them knows anymore than we do.<br><br>Regardless of how eagerly and hopefully we may cling to their answers.<br><br>Which is why, if we\u2019re curious about death (and let\u2019s face it, who isn\u2019t), there\u2019s no harm in trying to ask our questions of a different source, a source possibly closer to home.<br><br>We can try closing our eyes, beginning to notice that the body is carrying on its business of life, without us. Breath is taken care of, hearing and heartbeat and blood coursing- all of that is happening without our involvement or direction.<br><br>We can leave it to the body to carry on as it will.<br><br>And then, simply because why not, we can come right out and ask our deceased family member, our passed-away loved one, our no-longer-here pet- if they\u2019re dead.<br><br>\"Grandma, Fluffy, partner, friend- are you there? Are you dead? Does ANYONE die? Does this body die? Is it what I am? Do I die with it? Will I join you?\"<br><br>Now your friendly Mind-Tickler understands that this may sound ridiculous. Which is wonderful, isn\u2019t it? Ridiculous means there\u2019s nothing to lose and quite possibly a good laugh to be gained.<br><br>And who couldn\u2019t use a good laugh when thinking about the uncertain and often scary subject of death?<br><br>So no harm in listening carefully, with stillness, for an answer to each of these silly questions, asked one at a time.<br><br>A faint, barely perceptible answer. Maybe even just a sense rather than audible words.<br><br>Just for curiosity.<br><br>Astonishingly, answers might show up. Answers which are perhaps very different from our usual.<br><br>What the hell.<br><br>I mean, these folks are dead. Often they\u2019ve been gone for years.<br><br>And yet, somehow\u2026 a reply is received.<br><br>What\u2019s that about? Is it really the loved one answering? How is that possible?<br><br>Or is it our own wishful thinking, our own mind just making stuff up?<br><br>Or maybe it\u2019s be God, or consciousness, or awareness, source, Oneness?<br><br><em>What is it that\u2019s answering?<\/em><br><br>Of course no one knows.
