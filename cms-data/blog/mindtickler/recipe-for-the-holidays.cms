Expectation. Start with an empty bowl and fill it to the brim.<br>Asking for much? Nah. Only unrelenting happiness, love and joy! Family, party invitations, smiling, not too drunk faces? Must-haves. Happy happy happy! &nbsp;Never mind that if there are people around, pretty likely they're the very ones that have perfected various button-pushes for years. &nbsp;Y'know, kind of like the annual sharpening of the spears.<br><br>2). Comparison. Mix in the whole bottle.<br>That family member is successful and you\u2019re not. That old flame is married and you\u2019re not. That one has kids, they still like their parents and aren\u2019t addicted to whipped cream. You? No, no and no. Those others are thinner, fitter, younger, prettier, wealthier. They have all their hair, a savings account, more parties, more friends. That one is enlightened, for crying out loud. You? Pfffft.<br><br>Dammit.<br><br>3) Self evaluation. Fold in a year's worth.<br>Look backward. How\u2019d you do this year- is this the life you wanted at the end of 2016? &nbsp;Hah. Look at you alone, again, head deep in the pumpkin pie. Did you achieve, find true love, workout, get out of debt, do well as a parent? &nbsp;'Course not. Loser. &nbsp;<br><br>Few of us measure up in the best of times, let alone at this time of \u201creflection.\u201d Aka \u201cAnother year gone; what have I done.\u201d &nbsp;After all, odds are you\u2019re looking at pretty much the same failures as last year. And the year before that.<br><br>4) Future. Bake in those resolutions. Time to fix the mess that is your life.<br>Look forward. Make a list of those finally-get-to-it plans for redemption. Even though you're probably just lining up your failures for next year's step 3 (see above), still, may as well start next holiday season's potential \u201cYou blew it's\u201d early. &nbsp;Because c'mon, planning fix-its for the future can always be counted on to bring ease, peace and the end of anxiety. Right?<br><br>Mix steps 1 through 4 together thoroughly. &nbsp;Mmmm. Smell the doom, failure and tears along with strong whiskey and\/or 420 at this point.<br><br>Now that's holiday winning.<br><br>And one miserable fruitcake. &nbsp;Not the concoction. &nbsp;You.<br><br>Is it any wonder the holidays are less than jolly for so many people? Could there be a more effective ouch-filled recipe?<br><br>Not likely.<br><br>Although... if it\u2019s any consolation, despite thought saying, \"It\u2019s just you,\" at least odds are good that everyone else is going through some version of the exact same thing you are. While they're pretending to be joyful, of course. Just like you.<br><br>Because for pretty much everyone, the condition of being human comes with thoughts of More, Not Good Enough, and Inadequate Life Accomplishments.<br><br>No matter what you\u2019ve actually got, tried or accomplished.<br><br>So for a dash of something different, you might try the following recipe...<br><br>Maybe you\u2019re right- you're actually not good enough.<br><br>Maybe none of us is.<br><br>Because no one measures up to a fantasy existence where everything is only sweetness and families sing joy-fueled carols without any glimpse of trigger, or where money, love, happiness and self-esteem are overly plentiful.<br><br>So maybe you don't have to try so hard to fake not-possible ideals. Maybe it's possible to finally learn to make do with\u2026 this.<br><br>And maybe that could be OK.<br><br>Because your imperfect messed-up but always interesting personality might just be the ideal personification of what it is to be human.<br><br>Which means you fit right in. Perfectly imperfect as you are.<br><br>Oh my gosh, could it be you\u2019re good enough? &nbsp;<br><br>What a crazy concept!<br><br>That's why I\u2019m wishing you a giant slice of \u2018So What, This Is Good Enough\u2019 pie.<br><br>With extra As-You-Are a la mode.<br><br>Yummm.<br><br>So from one fruitcake to another\u2026.<br><br>Love you, and happy good enough.<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\">Get your Mind-Tickled every week<\/a>.<br>","extra":""}
