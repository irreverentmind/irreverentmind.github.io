And also our thought about ourselves, our idea of ourselves.<br>This is the person. In other words what people meet and understand, and what I understand as Alan Watts, is a big act, which is not really me.\"<br>--Alan Watts<br><br>----------<br><br>\u201dWe are nothing but images of images.<br>Reality, including ourselves, is nothing but a thin and fragile veil,<br>beyond which \u2026 there is nothing.\u201c<br>--Carlo Rovelli<\/em><br><br>Recently some family members sweetly informed me that they think my life choices \u2013not having children, living alone, not throwing dinner parties- indicate that something is very wrong with me.<br><br>Apparently my loved ones see me as socially damaged, afraid, isolated, and of course, plain ol\u2019 weird.<br><br>Whaattt? They don\u2019t see me as independent, free thinking, comfortable in my own skin? They see me differently than I like? This is an outrage!<br><br>I mean, if you\u2019re going to bother thinking about me, get it right will ya?<br><br>Let\u2019s face it, we all have a way we want to be seen- smart, caring, spiritually evolved, attractive, good.<br><br>We have a lifetime of carefully-honed presentation and story-building, as we try to \u201ccome across\u201d to others in those ways.<br><br>As in, we try to make others think right ideas about us.<br><br>Never mind that we also have personality quirks and odd little habits which don\u2019t fit those right ideas. There's the drawers and closets hiding chaos, the quick temper, the desire to be admired and better than others. There's all those compulsions, addictions, irritations and preferences.<br><br>Yeah we do our best to hide those.<br><br>Let\u2019s hide the social anxiety or suicidal thoughts or the indignation when someone calls us stupid or lazy or loser. Let\u2019s hide that we haven\u2019t had sex in years, that our skivvies have skid marks, that taxes are 5 years overdue, that we cower rather than confront, that we binge at night after eating very little in front of friends.<br><br>The self has secrets.<br><br>Because it must control the presentation.&nbsp;Because it must be defined&nbsp;somehow.<br><br>Otherwise the self is nothing. Otherwise we might realize that what we call \u201cMe\u201d doesn\u2019t exist.<br><br>Yes we know this. That\u2019s why it feels so necessary to hide so carefully, and to put our best foot forward, and to avoid situations where we can't do either.<br><br>Ok well, that\u2019s a big secret right there.<br><br>Unfortunately, periodically someone doesn\u2019t buy what we\u2019re selling. Periodically, despite all of our careful branding, someone sees us \u201cincorrectly\u201d.<br><br>Then the fact that the sham, the illusion, the fa\u00e7ade might be exposed suddenly becomes a possibility.<br><br>It is never a happy moment when that happens.<br><br>That\u2019s when we&nbsp;freak out with shame, fury, hurt, anguish. That\u2019s when we obsessively replay conversations in our heads, argue with no one in the shower,&nbsp;rehearse&nbsp;what to say next time.<br><br>We'll set them right, dammit.<br><br>Meanwhile really nothing has happened. Someone had a view of us which is not the view we wanted them to have.<br><br>Other than that, nothing.<br><br>And yet still it feels so important that people \u201cget\u201d us and see us right.<br><br>The sense of who we are rides on pretending images and identity are an actual person. The sense of who we are rides on flimsy things like others\u2019 opinions about us.<br><br>Otherwise there\u2019s nothing to hold onto.<br><br>Ok fine, what do we do with this?<br><br>Well,&nbsp;when we\u2019re upset in troubling&nbsp;situations,&nbsp;simply understanding&nbsp;that the pain comes from being identified in a way that clashes with the preferred view of ourself,&nbsp;can ease&nbsp;that upset a&nbsp;little.<br><br>We&nbsp;might&nbsp;think&nbsp;specifically&nbsp;about how we\u2019d like those people to see us.&nbsp;In this situation I want them to see me as normal, reasonable, right, lovable, successful, kind.&nbsp;Or whatever.<br><br>And then we might consider how those people actually do see us (as far as we know).<br><br>And notice they don\u2019t match.<br><br>That mismatch is the&nbsp;source of the&nbsp;fury, hurt,&nbsp;and shame.<br><br>That&nbsp;clash&nbsp;between the&nbsp;life-long&nbsp;image, up against the&nbsp;threat of exposure of its lie- that\u2019s what makes us feel bad.<br><br>Because to the hologram, of course it feels dangerous that the plug might be pulled.<br><br>Is this avoidable? Nope. Not even Ramana escaped the pain of being seen \u201cwrong.\u201d<br><br>The sense of self is built into every cell, every feeling, every thought. Maintenance of that illusion is a 24\/7 requirement.<br><br>That\u2019s the game here. There's no getting around it.<br><br>Luckily there can be a little peace, a little kindness, in that accepting that unavoidability.<br><br>There can be calm in seeing that we\u2019re doing our best as a wispy image.<br><br>Sometimes we succeed in fooling ourselves and others that we\u2019re more than that.<br><br>Sometimes we don\u2019t.<br><br>When we don\u2019t pull it off, it can be upsetting.<br><br>Even so, no view or opinion is a person.<br><br>No image or identity or story is a self.<br><br>Which leaves flimsy holograms with a whole bunch of nothing.<br><br>And also the relief of a whole bunch of<br><br>So what.<br>\u200b<br><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/a><\/strong>","extra":"","extra2":""}
