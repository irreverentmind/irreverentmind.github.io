When a man knows this, he lives for the first time in his life.\u201d<br>--Alan Watts<br><br><br>----------<br><br>\u201cThe wife is dear because of the love of the Self.\u201d<br>--Brahadaranyaka Upanishad<\/em><br><br><br><br>A friend of a friend\u2019s brother, someone I did not know, committed suicide this past weekend. The same day, a not-close-to-me elderly relative of my own also passed away.<br><br>Death was on the table for me this weekend.<br><br>Of course my heart went out to both families. I cried watching my cousins sob in the zoom funeral.<br><br>But I myself was not particularly overwhelmed with sadness or emotion.<br><br>Perhaps because there was a lot of relationship-space between me and these folks. I wasn't a part of either life.<br><br>And intensity of grief seems to depend on how involved we, the survivors, are in others' lives and situations.<br><br>More involved- more intense mourning. Less involved- less intense mourning.<br><br>Almost as if, if the self- the me- is not right at the center of things, there\u2019s no great pain.<br><br>And almost as if pain and intensity require the self to be center stage.<br><br>In fact weirdly, it starts to look like grief is actually more about concern for me the surviving self, than the deceased one.<br><br>Because no matter what any death\u2019s circumstances, or how it happens- even when it is someone sick and ready to go-<br><br>most survivors find reason to feel loss, guilt, anger, regret, and personal responsibility.<br><br>This becomes particularly clear in the case of suicides and accidents, where shock and mourning can be so intense.<br><br>Remaining family invariably wonders: Was this my fault? Could I have stopped it? Did I do enough? Did I let them down? How could I have let this happen? Should I have made that phone call, given the warning to drive carefully, taken their keys?<br><br>And even when death is not the result of an accident, and involves someone old and sick, still our pain manages to be about ourselves. I am lost. I have lost them. I will miss them. What happens to me now? &nbsp;What will my life be like without them? Where do I go from here? How will I go on?<br><br>There's an inevitable wonder about our own death and what we\u2019re in for someday, hopefully long down the road.<br><br>Is this what I\u2019m in for? Will my death be like this? Can I avoid it if I do things differently?<br><br>So much \u201cI\u201d in all those tears.<br><br>Turns out every heartbroken thought is actually about the me.<br><br>The death of others is used to verify our own sense of individual self.<br><br>We call this mourning the loved one.<br><br>When actually it\u2019s about our own loss. &nbsp;We mourn them for our loss, and our identity.<br><br>This might get easier to see in those (very) rare times when we can remove the self-based, \"But what about me and what I did\" concerns.<br><br>Because what remains then is often love-filled relief and a far more them-centered celebrating of the one who\u2019s gone.<br><br>We may be happy for them, glad they\u2019re not hurting anymore, considerably less sad.<br><br>Though of course the mind is capable of turning even fewer tears into some deficiency-meaning about us as an individual.<br><br>Non-intensity is seen as a betrayal of the loved one, or a sign we\u2019re forgetting them, or an indication that we don\u2019t care and are unloving and insensitive or somehow broken.<br><br>Otherwise we'd be crying, right?<br><br>Perhaps we can see that that is still more of the same- just the sense of me, defining and monitoring itself.<br><br>As usual.<br><br>Luckily for all of us, love is not defined by any particular number of tears.<br><br>And not one bit of this is bad or should be different.<br><br>This is how it is. This is what humans do. We make everything about us.<br><br>So we're still going to experience grief, and sometimes very intensely.<br><br>It\u2019s just that maybe we\u2019re grieving something other than we think.<br><br>Because humans are self-ish. Grief is self-ish. Bereavement is self-ish. Loss is self-ish.<br><br>As in, about the self.<br><br>So we may continue to hate the idea that someday these selves and the selves of our loved ones will cease to be.<br><br>We may cry about it. We may want to cling, to control, to carry on.<br><br>Most likely we will continue to involve ourselves in others' deaths.<br><br>Because let's face it- loss of the known, loss of the body, loss of the spark of existence,<br><br>whatever that is-<br><br>Well, it can seem very scary, mournful, and sad.<br><br>So final, so permanent.<br><br>Which, if we're lucky, may ultimately bring us around to wondering<br><br>if death is indeed<br><br>final.<br><br>With or without \"us.\"<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/strong><\/em><\/a><strong><em><br><\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&t=6s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Click here to watch Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump<\/strong><\/em><\/a><br><br><br><em>\u201cWhy mourn the dead?
