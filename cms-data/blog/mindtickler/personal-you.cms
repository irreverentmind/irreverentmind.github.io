Run fast and make your god happy.\u201d<br>--Ancient Sumerian text, approx. 3000 BC<br><br>----------<br><br>\u201cThere are no new thoughts.\u201d<br>\u2013Byron Katie<\/em><br><br><br>You think it\u2019s just you.<br><br>Or perhaps you have it worse than others, and your situation is especially bad.<br><br>Or maybe you grant that others do also suffer the same unfortunate afflictions in life, so you bond with them in solidarity against those normal different others who don\u2019t suffer this way.<br><br>That's when you join the autism group, the anxiety group, the positive-thinking mailing list. That\u2019s when you try the dating sites, sign up for podcasts about getting motivated, log in every night to the, \u201cI\u2019m enlightened and you\u2019re not\u201d groups.<br><br>You may think your issues are particular to you. But sit in my chair for a day or two and you start to notice that everyone says the same things. About the same kinds of troubles.<br><br>In fact, it's always the same handful of topics people end up discussing- self doubt\/self improvement, success\/achievement\/productivity, love\/relationships\/others, health\/death, addictions\/cravings, and enlightenment\/how to live life best.<br><br>All the usual stuff, showing up as feelings, goals, desires, shoulds, shouldn\u2019ts, likes and dislikes.<br><br>Turns out that when thoughts revolve around a recurrent set of limited topics, humans suffer.<br><br>All humans. Humans such as you.<br><br>Which is weird. I mean, you\u2019re unique, right?<br><br>Well, maybe your kind of suffering is a new phenomenon. Or maybe the current mass suffering of so many folks is a product of difficult current times, personal traumatic childhoods, the barrage of media and technology.<br><br><em>\u201cLife is suffering.\u201d \u2013Buddha, approx. 625 BC<\/em><br><br>Oh.<br><br>So apparently it\u2019s not new. Since Buddha lived about 2700 years ago.<br><br>In fact, dig back a little and it begins to be clear that people have been struggling with the exact same problems, saying the same exact stuff you say, about the same exact challenges,<br><br>For at least 8100 years. As far back as they\u2019ve found written words.<br><br>Thoughts identical to the ones you\u2019re lugging around have literally been around at least 8000 years.<br><br>So at least you\u2019re in good company. <em>Old<\/em> company, but still.<br><br>That thought about not being productive, or good enough, or lovable? The one about whether you should have another beer, or what other people think, or whether you\u2019re ugly or healthy or safe from death? The thought about whether you meditate enough or have achieved enough enlightenment, if your parents did you wrong, or if life has been too hard or if feelings could be escaped by death?<br><br>Ancient. Thousands of years old.<br><br>Bringing that old spiritual maxim, \u201cThoughts aren\u2019t personal,\u201d to a whole new level.<br><br>Because thousands-of-years-old thoughts can not be about you.<br><br>Childhood traumas, or cravings for booze, or fear of disapproval, or anger at others\u2019 obviously wrong behaviors, can\u2019t be about you or your life if they were also about Gilgamesh the Sumerian\u2019s life in 3000 BC.<br><br>Thoughts like, \u201c<em>I can\u2019t bear this feeling, maybe I should die<\/em>,\u201d or, \u201c<em>I\u2019m not reaching full potential, I\u2019m failing at life, love, enlightenment,\u201d c<\/em>an\u2019t have anything to do with you, if they were Shakespeare\u2019s lines for Hamlet in 1595, or in Aeschylus\u2019 scripts in approx. 500 BC.<br><br><em>\u201cIt would be better to die once and for all than to suffer pain for all one's life.\u201d \u2015Aeschylus, 500 BC<br><br>\u201cNobody lives the life he chooses to live.\u201d \u2014Menander, 4th cent. BC<\/em><br><br>Hmmmm. Seems you\u2019re very very late to the, \u201cIt\u2019s all me and mine,\u201d party.<br><br>It becomes clear that suffering has a script. Being human has a script.<br><br>A script which is not particular to any one person's life situations. A script which carries on over centuries, independent of any life's particular circumstances and feelings.<br><br>With words like, \u201c<em>My thoughts\u201d&nbsp;<\/em>and \u201c<em>My inner voice,\u201d&nbsp;<\/em>you have claimed authorship to what is not yours.<br><br>Fine. Who cares? How does it matter?<br><br>Well, it doesn't. Unless you like sanity.<br><br>Unless you'd like freedom from a lifetime of hating yourself, fixing, \u201cgoing inward,\u201d striving and never attaining.<br><br>Because once it\u2019s seen that all thought is ancient and repetitive and scripted,<br><br>there\u2019s no way to continue thinking it\u2019s you in particular with the problem.<br><br>There\u2019s no way to continue thinking suffering is about <em>your<\/em> trauma or <em>your&nbsp;<\/em>cheating spouse or <em>your&nbsp;<\/em>inherent lack of value.<br><br>It starts to be clear that it\u2019s just your turn to read the ancient lines.<br><br>Taking the you right out of it.<br><br>\u201c<em>Humans are born, they live, then they die, this is the order that the gods have decreed. But until the end comes, enjoy your life, spend it in happiness, not despair. Savor your food, make each of your days a delight, bathe and anoint yourself, wear bright clothes that are sparkling clean, let music and dancing fill your house, love the child who holds you by the hand, and give your wife pleasure in your embrace.
