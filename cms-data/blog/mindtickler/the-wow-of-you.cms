Oh I am sad. Look, he\u2019s leaving. Others are doing blah-blah and it feels terrible. This tastes great!\u201d<br><br>We\u2019re laser-focused on that <em>what<\/em>. &nbsp;A feeling, a thought, some colors, shapes and sounds, a body moving here or there? &nbsp;Yeah we are all about it.<br><br>Though sometimes, very occasionally, we might turn attention from What is being experienced to focus instead on Who is experiencing.<br><br>Then we observe The Experience-er.<br><br>\u201cLook, I notice what I\u2019m feeling! I notice my thoughts. I can observe myself, experiencing.\u201d<br><br>That shift in vantage point feels better sometimes. Not always solidly, not necessarily for long. But still, generally\u2026 better.<br><br>Whether it's the What or the Who, what's common to either perspective is the Me at the center of it all.<br><br>\u201cI am the experiencer, I am the one experiencing this, and I am the observer of it all.\u201d<br><br>Gosh it's familiar, isn't it, that notion of Me as center point? &nbsp;We\u2019ve been the locus of everything, the driver of every experience, since way back.<br><br>It makes us feel solid, and very central to the entire sense of existence.<br><br>\"This is happening to me, by me and about me.\"<br><br>That stance feels so very strong, it is almost never questioned. &nbsp;So we go with it as a given. We start from, \u201cI\u2019m right here, in the center of this experience. I\u2019m the one it\u2019s happening to,\" and then stick with that point of view no matter what. &nbsp;Most of the time it hurts, but oh well. It's the devil we know.<br><br>But what if that certainty of the self as the center point of all experience has been\u2026well, let\u2019s call it \u2026. misleading?<br><br>As in\u2026 ahem\u2026 wrong.<br><br>We don\u2019t want to be wrong, do we? That would be bad.<br><br>So let's play and have some fun for a few minutes, and try on something new. Who knows, maybe we\u2019ll find some rightness here.<br><br>So. What if you are not the one the experience, the dream, is happening TO?<br><br>What if you are not the owner of the dream, and not the dreamer? &nbsp;As in, what if it isn\u2019t YOUR dream, and you\u2019re not the one dreaming it?<br><br>What if you\u2019re the dream itself?<br><br>That would mean that literally, all sights, sounds, thoughts and feelings are what you ARE.<br><br>As in, the thought arises, \u201cI\u2019m a fraud,\u201d and what might it feel like if you are those words, literally?<br><br>Or the thought comes, \u201cOthers have it better.\u201d And what if now you are those words?<br><br>If you\u2019re open to consider that you are even the arguments with this idea\u2026 the annoyance, impatience, or fear that might be showing up at what crazy Judy is offering here\u2026<br><br>If you\u2019re open to just trying it on, for just a moment...<br><br>perhaps there\u2019s something different to be discovered.<br><br>Something that center-point Me is very much not used to.<br><br>Because when you consider the possibility that what you are IS all those thoughts starting with the word, \u201cBut\u201d, and IS the fear, resistance and impatience or annoyance\u2026<br><br>that you are the experience rather than The One Experiencing it\u2026<br><br>Well\u2026<br><br>Do you notice how the center ... disappears?<br><br>Can you sense how un-solid you are, if you\u2019re all those moving parts at once?<br><br>Look what happens to fury, indignation, resistance, hurt and fear, when those experiences are what you ARE.<br><br>If you are every experience, every word, every feeling and sight, do you notice the fluidity, the temporary, the no-centrality to hold on to?<br><br>You might even see that there is nothing that needs to hold on to something.<br><br>Almost like there is no you.<br><br>Like you\u2019re a whole bunch of nothing. Decentralized. As are others, too.<br><br>Of course, we\u2019re just playing here.<br><br>And yes, I know this isn\u2019t easy to consider.<br><br>If only because for decades, we have practiced such devotion to the story of Me, such dedication to, \u201cShut up you non-dual fruitcake! I\u2019m right here! This is what I am!\u201d<br><br>And we have a lifetime of training being entirely centered in self, a lifetime of residing so carefully within that delineated box, that shifting to non-center feels \u2026<br><br>Wrong. And weird. Very weird.<br><br>Of course the mind fights it.<br><br>But I hope you\u2019ll play with this anyway.<br><br>Because the weird-ness that comes from shifting focus from experience-er to experience itself, just might be what allows freedom from all boxes\u2026 including the \u2018certainty of self\u2019 container\u2026to happen.<br><br>Because even usually-locked doors are still capable of unlocking and opening. Which means there can always be the possibility\u2026 a possibility that has not happened with the usual approach\u2026 to see that ...<br><br>there is no box to get out of.<br><br>Not when you are the box. And the thoughts and feelings about the box. And the colors and shape of the box.<br><br>I mean...<br><br>Wouldn't if be something is it's all you?<br><br>Wouldn\u2019t it be something if it turned out that Weird\u2026<br><br>is actually...<br><br>Wonderfully... wrongly... wildly...<br><br>Wow?<br><br>","extra":""}
