That was an interesting experience.<br><br>Many lovely readers of last week\u2019s Mind-Tickler about validation became absolutely, positively, most definitely convinced it was written about you.<br><br>Y\u2019know, you personally.<br><br>Which was not the case. Saying again for those in the back-<br><br><em>it was not about you.<\/em><br><br>Not that you\u2019ll believe me.<br><br>You\u2019re quite certain I invalidated you, specifically, by writing a general email about validation.<br><br>Interesting that that particular topic sparked so much betrayal, hurt, anger, and unsubscribes.<br><br>The topic of Validating the Self caused hot feelings, walls, and defenses to rise up in a big way.<br><br>Let\u2019s face it, you want that darned self validated, dammit.<br><br>In every moment, by everyone you come across.<br><br>Everyone needs to legitimize you, your okness, your painful feelings, your trauma, your choices, your personality, your likes and dislikes.<br><br>Otherwise there\u2019s risk of discovering, over and over and over, that that treasured and protected self\/ego\/ person doesn\u2019t exist and is therefore<br><br>not possible to validate.<br><br>The self would very much prefer to not acknowledge this.<br><br>So instead, everything is perceived through the lens, the filter, of-<em> Is this about me? Can this be made personal?<\/em><br><br>Making all outside circumstances and other people\u2019s opinions usable, in order to define\u2026 you.<br><br>In fact, if something can not be made personal, then there\u2019s no concern about it. There\u2019s no interest in anything that has nothing to do with you.<br><br>If it<em> is<\/em>&nbsp;personal though, then it better be right. Otherwise there\u2019ll be hell to pay.<br><br>In the form of bad feelings.<br><br>One can be made happy or sad or angry depending on whether someone or something verifies you \u201cproperly.\u201d<br><br>Almost as if what happens out there actually, repeatedly, perpetually,&nbsp;createsyou.<br><br>Hmmm. Perhaps it's starting to become clear why last week's Mind-Tickler may have been upsetting to you.<br><br>Perhaps it's starting to become clear why being validated feels so important. Or why it feels so painful and infuriating if said validation doesn\u2019t happen.<br><br>The appearance of existence and survival of the self depends on being confirmed by others.<br><br>The last Tickler felt very personal and didn't verify the \"right\" you.<br><br>We understand this here at Mind-Tickler headquarters.<br><br>And we understand that your self has a right to its preferences and attempts at survival, and a right to want what it wants.<br><br>Whether Ticklers say the right things, liked things, or not.<br><br>We also understand that none of this can be helped, and that not one bit of this is important to see or understand.<br><br>Ever.<br><br>And though we can\u2019t always soothe the savage Self-beast, and can\u2019t always tickle it into having peaceful feelings,<br><br>hopefully you can know that The Mind-Tickler is always written with the You in mind, anyway.<br><br>Your likes, dislikes and strategies.
