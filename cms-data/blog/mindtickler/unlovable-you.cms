This is a wildly common thought.<br>","words":1066,"content":"People think they are unlovable.<br><br>Not in the sense of thinking about it all the time or constantly crying Woe Is Me, but deep down, in the so-called heart, yes this is a wildly common thought.<br><br>(If mind is now saying, \u201cWell not me! I don\u2019t think I\u2019m unlovable!\u201d, I\u2019ll just say, OK you are that rare exception. Just you though. No one else.)<br><br>Anyway, not that it matters what we think, because this is just a thought and it\u2019s not us and it\u2019s not real and has no power and it\u2019s just words and \u2026 y'know, yada yada.<br><br>It's just that this particular thought is so pervasive and feels so core that it\u2019s a great doorway into a different way of experiencing.<br><br>So in today\u2019s Mind-Tickler I\u2019m focusing on thought-content for a change. Because this one is everywhere, admitted or not.<br><br>Though I do realize that I\u2019m not supposed to acknowledge thoughts of unlovability. Unlovability is bad. C\u2019mon Judy, give us encouraging positives and empowerments! Give us manifesting! No one wants defeatist, discouraging negatives. That's so not cool.<br><br>See, this is why I can\u2019t have nice things. Because I\u2019m going to talk about it anyway.<br><br>For instance, can you see that the positive-outlook stuff is not natural for us humans?<br><br>Look how hard we have to work for the positive, how we have to rehearse affirmations and take courses and read books about how to develop it. Look what a hard time we have forcing ourselves to accept compliments instead of believing them effortlessly. Look how much energy and push it takes, how squirmy it is, to say openly, \u201cI am wonderful and lovable.\u201d<br><br>In contrast we don't have to work hard at all for the negative position. That comes one-two-three, even though we don't even want it.<br><br>Negative thoughts are the default, the start-point.<br><br>That's because the self story requires inadequacy in order to continue occupying so much mental real estate. Otherwise it starts to ebb away. And we can\u2019t have that.<br><br>But negative stories about ourselves can't be too obvious either. It's much harder to pretend that story is what we are when it is front and center. Which creates much craziness around trying to hide, change or not acknowledge the existence of unlovable-ness.<br><br>So many unwanted behaviors, addictions and reactions exist to keep this \"secret' from showing: manipulating for love, trying to be some version of \u2018normal\u2019, relationship counseling, inquiry, self help books, cosmetic surgery, diets,12-steps and tons more. Even the need for agreement and 'like-minded people' is an attempt to hide unlovable-ness.<br><br>\"See? Others agree with me! I'm part of a group! So I'm lovable! ... Right?\"<br><br>And it's not enough that we buy this false story of lovability; we want others to buy into it too. We like people who think we\u2019re great. &nbsp;We don't like people who don\u2019t think much of us. &nbsp;Even though we secretly don\u2019t think much of ourselves, we want them to.<br><br>We just want to fool them.<br><br>And woe to all if we don\u2019t fool them. &nbsp;We get terribly hurt and furious with people who don\u2019t fall for our presentation. Oh they make us crazy! Parents who didn\u2019t \u201cgive us what we need,\u201d critical teachers, disapproving unimpressed bosses. We want them to think we\u2019re great, dammit! &nbsp;\u201cHey don\u2019t you force me to notice my unlovability! How dare you! &nbsp;Look at me, I\u2019m beautiful and smart and sexy and successful. Cmon, don\u2019t you see?\u201d<br><br>Hello approval seeking. Hello in-authenticity.<br><br>Not to mention Comparing and Judgments, which, as any spiritual seeker knows, are Very Bad and should stop right now.<br><br>But we need them. When inadequacy is unacknowledged, we need to check ourselves against something, to find examples out there of both what we should be and aren\u2019t, and also what we\u2019re better than. Otherwise how are we going to know whether we\u2019re doing a good job of hiding the unlovability?<br><br>So this unlovable thing is very time consuming, a big part of what we\u2019ve come to accept as who we are. So it\u2019s not going away anytime soon.<br><br>Which tells us that maybe the problem isn\u2019t unlovability.<br><br>Maybe it\u2019s the denial, the idea that we shouldn\u2019t be unlovable.<br><br>Because really, why not? &nbsp;I mean, let\u2019s say it\u2019s true, we are indeed unlovable.<br><br>So what?<br><br>Is it the end of the world? &nbsp;Is there no room for imperfect un-lovables here on this planet? Must everyone be loveable?<br><br>How monotonous would that be?<br><br>What would happen if we were able to stop trying to hide or pretend inadequacy isn\u2019t there?<br><br>And even though chicken-little mind might start trotting out visions of consequences and saying \u201cNooo! You\u2019ll die alone, under a bridge, never getting anything done!\u201d right about now, it is just possible that the mind\u2019s presentations of disaster are (gasp) wrong, and that it\u2019s unable to predict the future.<br><br>So maybe we can at least consider not fighting unlovability. Just... consider. Because it could be it\u2019s the fighting and denial that has made us crazy. &nbsp;It could be that when we surrender to what (we think) we are, the relief in not fighting any more is huge.<br><br>\u201cYes I\u2019m unlovable. That\u2019s how it is. So what. What\u2019s for dinner?\u201d<br><br>It could be the end of trying endlessly to fix this Me thingy.<br><br>It could be the end of self-hatred.<br><br>Ironically. Paradoxically.<br><br>I mean, we might not even know who we are anymore.<br><br>Which, oddly enough, happens to be the desired outcome of so much spirituality and self-help.<br><br>And which just might be an easily, naturally positive experience. With no affirmations necessary.<br><br>Just the opposite, in fact.<br><br>Whoa.<br><br>","extra":""}
