There you are.<br><br>Like a perfect blue sky with not a cloud in it.<br><br>Just exactly right.<br><br>Stay with it.<br><br>Notice what happens after a few seconds or a minute or two\u2026.<br><br>The mind... wanders.<br><br>It\u2019s not interested.<br><br>It\u2019s\u2026<br><br>BORED.<br><br>Oh my gosh, even perfect isn\u2019t perfect.<br><br>Even perfect isn\u2019t\u2026. enough.<br><br>Wow, huh?<br><br>And if the perfect life is monotonous and uninteresting, imagine how dull your actual everyday life must be.<br><br>The day-to-day, day in day out life.<br><br>Ugh.<br><br>There must be should be more to life than this. This can't be all there is.<br><br>Shouldn\u2019t there be more... success, happiness, money, friends, adventure, travel, fun, love, excitement?<br><br>Shouldn\u2019t there be\u2026more?<br><br>Surely this isn\u2019t it.<br><br>I mean, what\u2019s the point?<br><br>So. Will life ever be enough?<br><br>Well, how could it be?<br><br>If even perfection is lacking, if even perfection isn\u2019t enough, then\u2026<br><br>No.<br><br>This life will never be enough.<br><br>Because even when things are great, we have little interest in perfect.<br><br>We lean toward dissatisfaction.<br><br>Our eye is perpetually drawn towards what isn\u2019t blue sky.<br><br>We look at the clouds, we look at the birds.<br><br>But just clear sky? Nah, bor-ing.<br><br>We want intensity. &nbsp;We want drama. We want excitement. We want something going on.<br><br>Even if it feels bad.<br><br>Because when something's happening, when we\u2019re in the middle of a big intense experience, there\u2019s no question we\u2019re alive, is there?<br><br>Could it be that\u2019s what intense feelings, dissatisfaction and boredom are for?<br><br>To prove there\u2019s a \u2018me\u2019 that\u2019s alive, real, unquestionably\u2026<br><br>Here?<br><br>I mean, whether its boredom or malaise or depression or panic or even something great like, say, happiness\u2026<br><br>Intensity demands attention.<br><br>We can't ignore it.<br><br>And in all of that focus we solidify the \u2018Me\u2019. &nbsp;<br><br>We solidify the story that what feels bored is \u2018Me\u2019.<br><br>Boredom does the job.<br><br>\"This isn\u2019t interesting, this isn't enough, I need something more.\u201d<br><br>Boom. There we are.<br><br>It works.<br><br>And of course, maybe it doesn\u2019t matter.<br><br>Although most of us don\u2019t much enjoy thinking our lives are monotonous, empty not-enough-nesses.<br><br>And if we happen to be seeking \u201cenlightenment,\u201d<br><br>or even if all we want is simply to feel better,<br><br>we might see that we can\u2019t do either by focusing on the deficiency of this moment.<br><br>That\u2019s not presence.<br><br>That\u2019s inadequacy.<br><br>Again.<br><br>So here's a scandalous idea...<br><br>What if it simply doesn\u2019t matter what we feel?<br><br>Whether happy, sad, bored or scared,<br><br>What if it\u2019s all simply irrelevant?<br><br>Now, I'm not saying \"Don\u2019t feel,\" (as if we could not).<br><br>I\u2019m saying what if it is irrelevant whether we feel something or not.<br><br>As in, \"OK, bored, yeah. Doesn't matter. Next.\"<br><br>As in, \"Hello again, habitual attraction to intensity and story of incomplete self.\"<br><br>I mean what if that\u2019s truly, literally, all boredom is?<br><br>Maybe then the thought that there must be more to life can stop being...<br><br>such a big deal.<br><br>\u201cOh my life is monotonous and uninteresting.\u201d<br><br>Ok. No biggie. No matter. What\u2019s for dinner?<br><br>Maybe then there's just a fleeting feeling and thought arising...<br><br>and that\u2019s about it.<br><br>And then, when we don\u2019t focus on the feeling and whether it\u2019s wanted,<br><br>or whether we're feeling it properly.<br><br>or whether it means something about this life \u2026.<br><br>we can notice what happens to the sense of lack...<br><br>when boredom can be here without a whole structure being built about it.<br><br>We might begin to see that...<br><br>boredom is a trick of thought.<br><br>No more no less.<br><br>Then it\u2019s a meaningless experience,<br><br>as good as any other,<br><br>and there's no need to fix or change.. any of it.<br><br>Same life.<br><br>Lots less work.<br><br>That might feel\u2026 oh, I don't know...<br><br><em>better.<\/em><br><br>Quiet.<br><br>Not boring.<br><br>Huh.<br><br>Perfect.<br><br>","extra":""}
