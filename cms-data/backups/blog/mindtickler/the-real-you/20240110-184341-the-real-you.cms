I contain multitudes.\"<br>--Walt Whitman<br><br>----------<br><br>\"Do you know that the word 'person' means 'mask'?

As in, that prancing goof playing on newer videos is this person\u2019s finally discovered, finally unleashed, \u201ctrue self.\u201d<br><br>I guess the previously non-prancing, serious person with the same name was a fake self. Happily, this teacher corrected this error and now feels free to connect with and show off to the world, their real-them inner clown.<br><br>I admit this left me with questions.<br><br>Such as... where did this teacher\u2019s previous self go,&nbsp;once it was dethroned- Bermuda? Where do once-real-but-now-aren\u2019t selves go to die?<br><br>And, is their old self gone forever?<br><br>And, is this new, gamboling character the entirety of what this person is? I mean, now that the rightful them has emerged, if a family member dies or some other misfortune occurs, will this person still blithely romp around?<br><br>After all,&nbsp;<em>True i<\/em>s true at all times.&nbsp;<em>True<\/em>&nbsp;is not variable.<br><br>And, how do they know this latest character is the legitimate one, and that this&nbsp;latest true self won\u2019t be replaced by yet another, different, true self at a future time?<br><br>And, maybe most curiously,&nbsp;when did a bunch of&nbsp;<em>behaviors<\/em>- for example, temporarily sashaying around in front of a camera- become a&nbsp;<em>self?<\/em><br><br>As I said, questions.<br><br>Now before you flood me with emails, let me say that of course I know what this teacher means.<br><br>It\u2019s just that it\u2019s\u2026 silly.<br><br>Because really, notice how anyone, including you, \u201cknows\u201d that one behavior is authentic and another one is fake.<br><br>That knowing is based on thought. Simply a thought. Just&nbsp;another thought.<br><br>A thought which brings along with it&nbsp;a feeling, whether liked or disliked. That feeling is said to confirm, to prove, the thought.<br><br>Thought says, \u201cThis right here is the real you! And this feeling proves it!\u201d And everyone says, \u201cYes!\u201d<br><br>This is the entire basis for notions of \u201cauthenticity\u201d and \u201cwho you are as a person.\u201d<br><br>On such untrustworthy sources, you \"know\" who and what you are.<br><br>Until tomorrow, when, in a new context, an entirely different&nbsp;<em>Real You<\/em>&nbsp;shows up.<br><br>Because of course, these self-things fluctuate, varying wildly based on context, situation, preference, conditioning.<br><br>Yet here is everyone trying to figure out which of those variances is the rightful one.<br><br>Meanwhile, one&nbsp;might wonder what even cares so dang much about this. What so wants to determine which of the many presentations of Self&nbsp;pulled out of the bag, is the genuine one?<br><br>As if it matters in the slightest.<br><br>Since nothing real has any need to define itself.<br><br>Only something pretending, or with something to hide, needs to constantly, continuously, make a presentation, a show, of pulling a rabbit out of a hat.<br><br>And then calling it the One True Rabbit.<br><br>Ta-daaaa!<br><br>So perhaps this confusion comes from the idea that there is a true self at all.<br><br>Because really look, and all you can&nbsp;find are&nbsp;temporary, changeable&nbsp;roles.<br><br>Play-acts, images, presentations.<br><br>\u201cActing like\u201d oneself. Not&nbsp;<em>being<\/em>&nbsp;one\u2019s actual self.&nbsp;<em>Acting like<\/em>&nbsp;it.<br><br>Which is pretend. The opposite of true.<br><br>No point in being authentic about a fake self.<br><br>And since all the facets of the Me are pretend,&nbsp;neither<em> being yourself<\/em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>not being yourself<\/em>&nbsp;is ever actually an option.<br><br>Since no role is a real person, and no role is the real you.<br><br>All portrayals, in any&nbsp;variation, can only be&nbsp;pretend.<br><br>So you\u2019re already as genuinely, legitimately, authentic as any&nbsp;rabbit in any hat can ever hope to&nbsp;be.<br><br>Leaving you with all the fun of being<br><br>all the rabbits<br><br>in all the hats.<br><br>For real.<br><br><img align=\"center\" alt=\"\" src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/1704911983157.jpg\" width=\"252\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 19%;\"><br>","extra":"","extra2":""}
