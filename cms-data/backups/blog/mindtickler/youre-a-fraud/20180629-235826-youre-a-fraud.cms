She needed to be kept secret.<br><br>Was that hidden Judy the real authentic one?<br><br>For that matter which was the authentic David Banner, the nice guy or the raging Hulk?<br><br>Most people believe that there\u2019s a true self and a fraud self.<br><br>But which is which?<br><br>'Course, delving into which self is real is like trying to determine which is the true space- the stuff inside your home or the stuff out there by the moon.<br><br>I mean, it\u2019s all space; in fact it\u2019s all the <em>same <\/em>space.<br><br>And besides, there\u2019s nothing there- it\u2019s <em>space.<\/em><br><br>But anyway... which is the so-called real Me? The hidden one seems like it's real doesn't it? The prettied-up smiley one feels false.<br><br>Because obviously no one would have to work so hard to package and pretty-up something real, right?<br><br>But do we <em>know<\/em> there is such a thing as a true or false self at all? What\u2019s the proof?<br><br>Usually people answer by saying things like, \u201cWhen I\u2019m not myself it doesn\u2019t feel good. When I\u2019m inauthentic it feels bad in my body.\u201d<br><br>So what most of us call 'authentic' is a feeling we like better than another feeling that we don\u2019t like, one feeling that is more soothing than another. &nbsp;<br><br>By that logic though, the hidden Hulk self can\u2019t be the authentic one, because it feels awful and it comes with shame and guilt, which also feel bad.<br><br>So that can't be it.<br><br>Which leaves the covered up, pretend-nice lipsticked one as the authentic one.<br><br>Wait. What?<br><br>Perhaps it makes no sense to determine what\u2019s real by a feeling.<br><br>Instead maybe we could consider, just for a moment\u2026<br><br>What if we are never what we seem to be?<br><br>What if we are always frauds?<br><br>What if no story... not nice Me, mean Me, smart Me, funny Me or weird Me\u2026 is what we are?<br><br>Perhaps we are all living a lie, all the time. Even when some feeling seems to verify realness.<br><br>We might just feel false and inauthentic because we are false and inauthentic.<br><br>Because as long as we think this body and these variable roles and circumstances are what we truly are, we are living a lie.<br><br>It could be it\u2019s just not possible to be human, posing as what we are not, and not be a fraud.<br><br>Because the Self is a character, a role.<br><br>And a character is not a real thing.<br><br>Which means the character can\u2019t do anything but pretend.<br><br>As long as we think there\u2019s a true Me, pretense is all we\u2019ve got.<br><br>We\u2019ll never be a better or truer fake character.<br><br>That\u2019s not even what we want anyway- to be a better fake.<br><br>That\u2019s the opposite of authentic.<br><br>So maybe it can be seen that as humans, there is no choice.<br><br>We have to accept the pretense.<br><br>And once that is seen, we might not have to continue working so hard to maintain better-looking appearances, or to be a truer, more authentic, more real Me.<br><br>We might be able to relax into the fakery.<br><br>We might even be able to let go of some of the guilt for being being inauthentic when we can see there's no choice.<br><br>We might even enjoy the show of it.<br><br>Because yeah we\u2019re pretending to be somebody.<br><br>Yeah we\u2019re inauthentic.<br><br>And so what?<br><br>Where\u2019s the problem?<br><br>What real authentic thing even cares or needs it different?<br><br>","extra":""}
