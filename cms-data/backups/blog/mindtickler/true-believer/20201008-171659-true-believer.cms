You only have to believe things that are not true.\"<br>--Tom Thompson<\/em><br><br>Today a Loves-Trump friend got curious and left Fox News to check out what another news network showed. She was horrified. How negative the not-Fox station was about Trump, how they featured only stories that made him look bad, how shockingly they were biased against him!<br><br>\u201cAll they do is lie about Trump! That is not news, that is opinion! You have to be ignorant not to see it. I can\u2019t believe there are so many stupid and gullible people out there! They believe all those obvious lies!\u201d she wrote. <em>(All quotes and exclamation points free of charge.)<br><\/em><br>All her Loves-Trump friends completely agreed. &nbsp;One recommended another station for more accurate Trump-supporting news.<br><br>Meanwhile, a Hates-Trump friend wanders on to Fox to see what stories they're telling, to see how they falsify and pretty up and downright hide any info unless it shows Trump in a wonderful light.<br><br>She also sputters with outrage, she also can\u2019t believe people actually believe all those lies, she also generously trots out the exclamation points.<br><br>\u201cThey misconstrue the story line to fit their narrative! Interjecting their personal opinion! It\u2019s so obviously lies! They believe it! How stupid are they? How can anyone still support this evil man?\u201d<br><br>Huh. Loves-Trump folks say the exact same word-for-words as Hates-Trump folks.<br><br>Weird.<br><br>So who\u2019s right? Who tells the truth?<br><br>Friends, you can trust only me. And maybe you, if you agree with me. Duh.<br><br>OK, OK, to be more accurate, no one is right. Not me, not you, not the other guys. Not no one.<br><br>Yes, I\u2019m sorry. I realize it\u2019s absolutely certain that what you believe is true, and that I am an ignorant idiot for writing such ridiculous nonsense.<br><br>I mean, it\u2019s called \u201cTruth,\u201d for goodness\u2019 sake. There\u2019s a right answer. Truth is truth. Somebody\u2019s right.<br><br>Although, if anger shows up just from reading these questions, it could be worth wondering why.<em>&nbsp;Why<\/em> is it so ferociously necessary to know what\u2019s true or who\u2019s right? What is so fragile that it needs that righteously angry f-you snit if it doesn't get agreement?<br><br>Anyway, the thing is, the news on any \u201cside\u201d has to be selectively edited and reduced in some way, because there is simply no way the human mind can take in the vast amount of available info.<br><br>Data must be made bite-sized so that it can be squeezed into a tidy and manageable human<br><br>point of view. &nbsp;<br><br>That requires a sieve, a bias, a perspective. News presenters choose info that will pass through their audience's particular does-it-fit-here filter. Everything else is left out or adjusted to fit.<br><br>And of course it's not just the news. &nbsp;Every single living moment, humans are eliminating huge tons of data. It can't all be taken in, so all experience must be constantly pushed through a slanted, biased, point-of-view screen. <em>(There\u2019s tons of science about this.)<\/em><br><br>Which is why we have zero ability to know what's been left out. We have zero ability to know what we don\u2019t know.<br><br>Which is how one person can look at Donald Trump and see a successful, powerful, superior-gened hero who gets things done, and another sees the exact same guy as a broke, bloated, corrupt, lying narcissist who ruins everything he touches.<br><br>It's not possible to know what's true. About anything.<br><br>It's only possible to <em>believe&nbsp;<\/em>rather than know.<br><br>It\u2019s always just <em>beliefs<\/em>. That\u2019s all we have.<br><br>We call them facts but they\u2019re only facts to us and to our similarly-biased team, from within the selective filters. To others, those same \"facts\" are lies.<br><br>\u201cCan you believe xyz happened?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe that news station.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe others don\u2019t see it.\u201d \u201cI believe that\u2019s true.\u201d<br><br>Beliefs are not facts. Beliefs are not truth.<br><br>Beliefs are faith <em>in the filter.<\/em> They\u2019re trust in the screened, selected experience.<br><br>And beliefs change.<br><br>Truth, not so much.<br><br>We have nothing without beliefs. Literally nothing.<br><br>We're not big fans of nothing. So humans are drawn like flies to beliefs..<br><br>Because it\u2019s person-al. Because opinions define us, tell us who and what we are. Because points of view give us verification of self.<br><br>So we cling to our perspectives with great urgency. We fight for them, hate others for them, defend, protect, and deify them.<br><br>In the name of rightness and \u201ctruth.\u201d<br><br>We call this \u201dtrusting our own mind.\u201d Of course we have to do that in order to live in this world.<br><br>But in actuality we can\u2019t ever really trust it. It\u2019s biased, slanted and completely blind. at all times.<br><br>Lucky for us, seeing that we truly don\u2019t know jack--s---about absolutely anything can create a tiny bit of space, a small opening, in the bricked-in wall of belief.<br><br>Which can bring an oddly unfamiliar calm. Spaciousness. Peace. Even some clarity.<br><br>Truth has a way of doing that.<br><br>Of course we always still have our many beliefs and opinions, we still take political action, still choose a side, still pretend to know things.<br><br>But knowing that we never ever actually do know \u201ctruth\u201d is such a relief.<br><br>Which unexpectedly expands, rather than limits, the mind. Paradoxically giving access to something bigger, truer, and less pin-downable.<br><br>Which perhaps is something worth believing in.<br><br>Or not.<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>I mean, that\u2019s a story<em>&nbsp;I&nbsp;<\/em>can believe.<br><br>But hey, that would just<br><br>be me.<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe<\/a> to get your Mind-Tickled every week. <br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&t=6s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump. &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/a><br><br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BAa3UCEyROQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Watch Judy and Robert Saltzman chat here. &nbsp;<\/a><br><br><br><img alt=\"\" src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/1602177326958.jpg\" width=\"251.99999999999997\" align=\"middle\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 20.28%;\">","extra":""}
