We don\u2019t like them in others. We despise them in ourselves.<br><br>Even though this, <em>F<\/em><em>lawed is bad<\/em> point of view has made so many lives a full-on misery of self-dissatisfaction.<br><br>I mean, look at <em>you&nbsp;<\/em>for example, sitting there all cracked and weird.<br><br>Look at that quick anger, those unloving judgments, the depressions, the secret shames.<em>&nbsp;(What, you thought you were the only one?)<\/em> Watch you yell at the kids, make mistakes, or freeze in order to not make any.

Because imperfections are the&nbsp;only&nbsp;option. Nothing else exists.<br><br>Nature creates all these infinite configurations and varieties of experience, and then humans, with our delightful humility, come along and say, \u201cNo no no! That\u2019s broken and bad!\u201d<br><br>And we get to fixing, smoothing, therapizing, inquiring and satsanging.<br><br>Seems this&nbsp;wacky human&nbsp;species only wants&nbsp;sameness and duplication.<br><br>As if Barbie is somehow better than a real girl.<br><br>As if sameness is ideal rather than dull, tedious, monotonous.<br><br>So for a bit of new fresh thinking, we might start with checking whether&nbsp;what we think of as flaws, are&nbsp;actually flaws.<br><br>Y'know, as opposed to treasures.<br><br>We might consider whether our unwanted reactions and despised peculiarities actually need standardizing,<br><br>or whether they offer&nbsp;a unique, valued and valuable contribution&nbsp;to the consciousness&nbsp;experience.<br><br>Distinguishing&nbsp;us&nbsp;from&nbsp;lifeless, duplicatable, always identical,&nbsp;plastic.<br><br>It could be that our&nbsp;ADHD,&nbsp;or discomfort in social situations, or recurrent worrying, or&nbsp;kooky sexual preference, might be something to be esteemed&nbsp;instead of hidden, appreciated instead of fixed&nbsp;and whitewashed.<br><br>We may have had it wrong all this time.<br><br>It may be worth considering the usually rejected possibility that\u2026<br><br>There\u2019s nothing wrong with us.<br><br>And that not matching the ideal&nbsp;is&nbsp;the ideal.<br><br>Alive, odd,&nbsp;wrong, unfixed, us.<br><br>Like an artful little cracked pig\u2026<br><br>Beautiful and interesting<br><br><em>with<\/em>&nbsp;its flaws.<br><br>Because&nbsp;of its flaws.<br><br>Perfect.<br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\">Click to get in on the Mind-Tickler every week<\/a>","extra":"","extra2":""}
