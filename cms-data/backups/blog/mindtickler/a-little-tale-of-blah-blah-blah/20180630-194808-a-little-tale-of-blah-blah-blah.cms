Belly full? smile. Fingers wiggling? coo.<br><br>No evaluation. No analysis. No judgment.<br><br>Just life-ing.<br><br>And then language got ahold of us.<br><br>And it stole happy right out from under us.<br><br>Because by age 2, we were a name, we were a good girl or boy, we were nice or sweet or smart or selfish or lazy.<br><br>And that was a shoe, this was a ball, that was a sister.<br><br>Things were identified.<br><br>We were identified.<br><br>By words.<br><br>And of course we didn\u2019t notice, because who does really,<br><br>That we had begun removing ourselves from existence,<br><br>In order to label and evaluate it.<br><br>Because words are symbols for things, not things themselves.<br><br>So they essentially separate us from experience.<br><br>Language describes existence, instead of simply the living of it.<br><br>And so, with a full vocabulary in our pockets, we were talking about things, thinking about things,<br><br>Deciding if this was good or bad, right or wrong.<br><br>As if we were a step removed from presence, from the simple experience of living,<br><br>And we, instead\u2026<br><br>Observed, monitored and judged,<br><br>Identified and labeled life...<br><br>Via language.<br><br>And with that full bag of words at our disposal, came\u2026<br><br>Thoughts.<br><br>Oh boy!<br><br>Fun, huh?<br><br>Well OK yeah, maybe that\u2019s not quite the word we'd use for thinking.<br><br>Though without words, thoughts are not possible.<br><br>Which is why it\u2019s perhaps not coincidental that some people have described awakening as a \u201cwordless\u201d experience.<br><br>Perhaps language and the meaning it comes with, and its symbolism and self-consciousness, is what has made mankind\u2026<br><br>Batsh*t crazy.<br><br>Now I\u2019m not saying things would be better without words,<br><br>Because words are the building blocks of what we in this dream world call a \u201cfunctioning person.\u201d<br><br>I\u2019m just asking what might we be left with, and what would life be like, if we were incapable of language?<br><br>Maybe just an experience of sitting somewhere, like in the sun maybe.<br><br>Though not even that, when there\u2019s no word for sitting or sun or experience.<br><br>Perhaps we can start to sense how..<br><br>Diffuse...<br><br>Decentralized\u2026<br><br>Things might become...<br><br>Without describers of any kind.<br><br>How there\u2019d suddenly be no Me, no ego, no person.<br><br>I mean, there can\u2019t be self-watching and navel-gazing without language.<br><br>No words, no self.<br><br>No sun, no body, no preferences, no shoelaces either.<br><br>No anything.<br><br>Just\u2026<br><br>Blank...<br><br>Amorphous...<br><br>Mind-less...<br><br>Experience.<br><br>Huh.<br><br>People pay a whole lot of money to spiritual teachers and retreats trying to get that experience of words going silent.<br><br>And when we consider how often we label our experiences as problems or painful, well\u2026<br><br>Wordless starts looking pretty good.<br><br>Though again, I\u2019m not saying we should drop language.<br><br>Because first of all, that\u2019s not even possible.<br><br>And second, even if it somehow was possible, we\u2019d still need to know our names and sign checks and read important things like the Mind Tickler and all. \u200b<br><br>I\u2019m just saying, perhaps we can at least notice where all trouble, sense of self, pain, unhappiness and lack of presence (more words) comes from.<br><br>Because once we do start to catch on,<br><br>And once we do start having some fun watching how language forms every single bit of our reality,<br><br>Things kind of go\u2026<br><br>Quiet.<br><br>Still.<br><br>Simple.<br><br>Poof.<br><br>Ah.<br><br>- &nbsp;- &nbsp;- &nbsp;-<br>- &nbsp;- &nbsp;- &nbsp;-<br><br>Sorry, did you say something?<br><br>","extra":""}
