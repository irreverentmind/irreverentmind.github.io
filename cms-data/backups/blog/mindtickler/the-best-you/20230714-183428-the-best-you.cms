That\u2019s CRAZY.\"<br>--Byron Katie<\/em><br><br>----------<br><br>Think of \u201cthe best you.\u201d<br><br>Y'know, the social one who comfortably says the right things, the successful one who gets lots done, the creative who produces great stuff, the talented winner of the sport.<br><br>The self you want to be. Confidant, unselfish, knowledgeable, articulate, loving. Or whatever.<br><br>The ideal self.<br><br>See it?<br><br>Can you notice that in the mind\u2019s eye, there are images of that best you?<br><br>Whenever thinking about who or how you want to be in any situation, those images show up to light the way.<br><br>Kind of like an internal pep rally:<em> Be this! You can do it! Yaaaay team!<\/em><br><br>When you\u2019re evaluating if you\u2019re a good person, or if you\u2019re lovable, or if you did well, those images are the standard by which you judge yourself.<br><br>Yep, that's what you're measuring yourself against- mental pictures.<br><br>And not just any mental pictures. Idealized mental pictures, of fictional you-perfection.<br><br>Pie-in-the-sky portraits&nbsp;of&nbsp;a person.<br><br>Who doesn\u2019t exist.<br><br>Because let's face it, that person is not you.<br><br>That\u2019s why you\u2019re trying so hard, wishing so much, to become that.<br><br>So there you are in the middle of every situation, watching and comparing to those very fast, auto-pilot idealized images.<br><br>And the constant determination of \u201cAm I doing well?\u201d is based on how closely your behavior and feelings match that exemplary image of supposed-you.<br><br>Come close to matching the pictures, and you feel pretty darn good.<br><br>Doesn\u2019t seem quite fair though, does it, for the standard of measurement of your value as a person to be riding completely on mentally conceived pixels of perfection.<br><br>Because, I mean,<em> idealized.<\/em><br><br>As in,<em> ideal.<\/em><br><br>And now think of you as you \u201creally are.\u201d People annoy you, not near enough gets done, you\u2019re not enlightened, you\u2019re bad unlovable inadequate wrong lacking.<br><br>Do you notice these are images too?<br><br>Images of the opposite of perfection- aka not-ideal, screw-up, you. Clenching in the tennis match, ruining the painting or song, blurting out the wrong thing, snapping at the kids.<br><br>Idealized bad, rather than idealized good.<br><br>That\u2019s what most folks mean by, \u201cthe real me.\u201d<br><br>Mental pictures that come with a bad feeling.<br><br>Luckily the good news is that neither image- not the good or the bad, the feeling or the no-feeling portrayal- is you.<br><br>Because<em> no image is a person.<\/em><br><br>Yet this is what \u201cliking yourself\u201d comes down to: how closely the portrait of not-enough-you matches the portrait of ideal-perfect-you in any situation.<br><br>Comparing one mental depiction to another.&nbsp;<em>Coming close<\/em>&nbsp;feels good.&nbsp;<em>Nowhere near <\/em>feels terrible.<br><br>Fine. Why does this matter?<br><br>Well of course it doesn\u2019t. It can be informative though.<br><br>Because a hefty percentage of everyone's suffering- depression, anxiety, and \u201cfailure\u201d- is simply this unnoticed comparison<br><br>of one idealized image to another idealized image.<br><br>One mirage compared to another.<br><br>Calling those unnoticed, stylized, mental depictions- \u201cMe.\u201d<br><br>The delusion that any picture is \u201cMe\u201d makes for a bunch of unhappy, feeling-inadequate, humans.<br><br>Yeah humans aren\u2019t nuts at all.<br><br>To be clear though, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s an alternative. This mega-fast comparing cannot be stopped.<br><br>Still, simply noticing this images-aren\u2019t-me game might bring a little more sanity, a little less beating-up dislike of the self, a little more acceptance and awareness of all the pretend.<br><br>In either idealized direction.<br><br>So the next time you feel bad about yourself, watch the images that bubble up.<br><br>See what you're comparing yourself&nbsp;to.&nbsp;Look at&nbsp;the<em> I-Should-Be-That<\/em>&nbsp;images, and the&nbsp;<em>Oh-No-This-Is-Bad <\/em>images.<br><br>Notice that you are indeed comparing them, and measuring yourself by that comparison.<br><br>Notice the conclusions about who you are as a person, resulting from this comparing.<br><br>And then, notice you are noticing.<br><br>Not because it\u2019s necessary.<br><br>But maybe because it can feel better to see that the \u201cbest-you\u201d goal you\u2019ve been striving for all along<br><br>is smoke and mirrors.<br><br>Maybe it can feel better to see a mirage for the not-real it is,<br><br>Rather than perpetually trying to reach<br><br>or become<br><br>something which<br><br>isn\u2019t there.<br> ","extra":"","extra2":""}
