How can there be so much wrongness, so much suffering?<br><br>After all, suffering is bad. Blood, screams, torture- bad. Dead expectant mothers, dead newborns, dead families trying to escape- bad.<br><br>A good life does not include pain and most certainly does not include bombs.<br><br>We know this. It simply should not be this way.<br><br>Why not?<br><br>Well, I mean, because we don\u2019t like it. Because anguish doesn\u2019t feel good.<br><br>Y\u2019know, to us.<br><br>Turns out, how-things-are-supposed-to-be is determined by each individual human, what we each believe is right and wrong,<br><br>And whether we like what\u2019s happening.<br><br>Don\u2019t like= Shouldn\u2019t happen. Do like = Yes please, more of that.<br><br>We judge what\u2019s acceptable and reject whatever isn\u2019t liked.<br><br>So then there\u2019s the unliked happening, as well as unliked feelings ABOUT the happening, and also the vague unspoken sense that we have no business adjudicating right and wrong, even if it\u2019s just to ourselves.<br><br>All this comes down to a point of view, a perspective, which is entirely human-centric.<br><br>And Me-centric. Self-centric.<br><br>As in, centered around the self.<br><br>There\u2019s the self- aka us, the evaluators- and then there\u2019s everything else- that which we\u2019re evaluating.<br><br>Which is outside of us.<br><br>Suffering happens to us. Pain is forced on us.<br><br>We are continually enduring unwanted, outside-us, happenings.<br><br>Confirming that we are separate from, and outside of, experience.<br><br>Reified. Distinct. Individual.<br><br>Although this is the opposite of, There\u2019s only one. This is the opposite of, Allowing everything to be as it is. This is the opposite of, This is it.<br><br>Hmmm.<br><br>Could it be there is another point of view than the limited human perspective?<br><br>Because all we have to do is look around for a half a moment and it starts to seem patently obvious that existence\/consciousness\/god\/awareness\/source\/the infinite (pick your name of choice) likes it just like this, wants it all, relishes it all, revels in it all.<br><br>Including suffering, blood, agony, death, bombs, war, and injustice.<br><br>So I wonder what would happen to our solidified likes and dislikes and dread upon seeing today\u2019s news, if we could play with BEING those experiences.<br><br>What if we could try on being the scream, being the explosion, being the blood and the color red?<br><br>What if what we are is literally every pain, every sensation, every sound, every thought and feeling?<br><br>Rather than an outsider who is forced to experience unwanted, separate-from-self, happenings. Rather than a solid, separate, feeler, thinker, disapprover, accepter, and evaluator to whom things happen.<br><br>Who knows, we might begin to notice how very, very different every experience becomes,<br><br>when it\u2019s what we are.<br><br>We might even discover an as-yet unseen beauty in pain, in screams, in dislike.<br><br>Does this change the world? &nbsp;<br><br>No.<br><br>Does it eliminate suffering (a suffering consciousness has so clearly enjoyed for thousands if not millions of years?)<br><br>No.<br><br>OK then, does it make us like everything that happens?<br><br>No.<br><br>But it does make us actually, literally, all that happens.<br><br>Which is pretty neat.<br><br>And then there\u2019s not two.<br><br>There\u2019s ONLY-ONE.<br><br>And we are that one.<br><br>And that one<br><br>is us.<br><br><br><em>\"All is just as it should be, right now. Not because it is a potential for something better, but because all that is, is divine expression.<br>All appearance is source.
