When the doctor came out, everyone wanted to know what they talked about, suspecting some great revelation had been passed on. The doctor said, \u2018We were having a wonderful time discussing Clint Eastwood movies. We are both Clint Eastwood fans.\u2019 \"<br>\u2013Tom Thompson<\/em><br><br><br>Over the years The Mind-Tickler has written about many grand consciousness-raising topics.<br><br>Under guise of seeming lightness, we have considered awareness, enlightenment, vastness, self, no-self, thought, mind, suffering, free will, choice, and happiness. We\u2019ve examined the nature of reality, and whether there even is such a thing.<br><br>We have quoted philosophers, mathematicians, neuroscientists, and physicists.<br><br>If that isn\u2019t grand and serious business, I don\u2019t know what is.<br><br>Mixed in with all of that importance have been many Mind-Ticklers covering the not-in-the-least grand. Perhaps even the downright ridiculous.<br><br>As in, y\u2019know, the human.<br><br>The What-the-Hells of everyday life. The money and health worries, mistakes, failures, lack of motivations, shames, politics. The social media block buttons, laundry and housekeeping dust bunnies.<br><br>Yep. Not grand.<br><br>Why does The Mind-Tickler bother with such untranscendent nonsense? &nbsp;Why even talk about the mundane tribulations of the false self?<br><br>I mean, it\u2019s not real anyway.<br><br>Shouldn\u2019t we stick to loftier discussions where enlightenment might happen, and human messes no longer apply?<br><br>Let\u2019s face it, lots of good folks reading The Mind-Tickler hope that some right words will catapult them into the vastness of enlightenment, thereby making human ego - &nbsp;the convoluted, angry, scared, sad, regret-filled, human ego-<br><br>go <em>poof.<\/em><br><br>Never mind that it\u2019s ego itself which supposedly wants to make itself go <em>poof.<\/em><br><br>Claiming it really really wants\u2026 its own extinction.<br><br>And also managing not to notice that said poof has happened to exactly no one through all of known history.<br><br>Ramana was still Ramana. Krishnamurti, Nisargadatta- not one was a poofed, unrecognizable, egoless person. Not one transcended their personhood.<br><br>Well, that\u2019s inconvenient.<br><br>Still, lots of folks hope to make what they understand is a fictitious character, die or disappear anyway.<br><br>Ego-death seems desirable.<br><br>Though, what would be left if they were successful and ego did finally <em>poof <\/em>into nothingness?<br><br>Well, that would be - nothing. <em>Nothing <\/em>is what would be left.<br><br>Because the person, the illusion- this is where humans live.<br><br>Love, joy, bliss, tears, fury, terror\u2013everything is experienced via the character.<br><br>Without the ego as fulcrum through which experience happens, there\u2019s nothing.<br><br>Don\u2019t take my word for it. Try experiencing anything, hearing anything, feeling anything, knowing enlightenment is happening, without the illusion of you.<br><br>The illusion of you is where everything known is experienced.<br><br>That includes enlightenment. That includes awareness of awareness.<br><br>In fact, \u201cattaining enlightenment\u201d specifically requires us to <em>NOT<\/em> go <em>poof.<\/em><br><br>Because existence requires\u2026 existence.<br><br>Not non-existence.<br><br>Luckily for us ego-types though, the character is where the fun is. The character is what experiences the scary movies, the roller coasters, the tear-filled novellas, ballgames, artistry, chocolate, sex.<br><br>Self is where the juice is.<br><br>It may be a dream, a stage, a play. It may be a story.<br><br>But it's fascinating. And we adore story. &nbsp;<br><br>In fact, remove story and what\u2019s left is heavy, dull, dry, uninteresting. What\u2019s left is weighty.<br><br>Which is the exact opposite of the blissful transcendence supposedly desired by poof-seekers.<br><br>So yes, The Mind-Tickler sometimes turns to everyday tribulations, dramas and pains of the non-existent self.<br><br>Why not? It\u2019s fun. And as it happens, all of that is included in consciousness too.<br><br>So while till now, disappearing the ego somehow may have seemed like an answer,<br><br>since it hasn\u2019t worked so far, maybe we can try something different.<br><br>Maybe we can consider enjoying the hell out of ego\u2019s weird and wacky experiences, pleasant or not- rather than continually attempting to escape this human business.<br><br>Because Krishnamurti liked Clint Eastwood movies and luxury and cigarettes. Alan Watts liked drugs. Ramana liked his cow and his mountain and his rice cooked just so.<br><br>None of them transcended personality.<br><br>Escaping ego is not an option.<br><br>So we may as well make friends with it.<br><br>As is.<br><br>And ironically that ego, and the mundane, and the disapproved-of, and the everyday trivialities-<br><br>just might be where freedom has lived all along,<br><br>Anyway.<br><br>Besides, this ego-bound life business will be over soon enough.<br><br>No sense rushing that.<br><br><br><br><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe and get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/a><\/strong><br><br><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&t=6s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Watch Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump<\/a><\/strong><br><br><em>\"I am so appreciative that the insights that come my way do not turn me into an emotionless thing with no personality.
