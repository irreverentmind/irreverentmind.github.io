Humans have to be worthy. Humans have to find a way to qualify, by meeting a requirement to have purpose, meaning, a raison d'\u00eatre.<br><br>Humans must boost whatever existence already has going, with some value-add.<br><br>Or else.<br><br>Or else guilt, shame, depression, worry, and suicidal thoughts.<br><br>Never mind that the \u201ccontribution\u201d we add is not very well defined. I mean, what would be a worthy-of-life Point?<br><br>How can a mere human contribute to existence?<br><br>Must we help the poor, or a family member in crisis, or impress the company with illustrious ideas at work, or save the climate, in order to deserve to live?<br><br>And exactly how much contributing is required? Must we help&nbsp;all&nbsp;people, or just a few? Must&nbsp;it be 24\/7, or are we allowed nights off, weekends off, long breaks?&nbsp;What percentage of our time on earth needs to be purposeful?<br><br>We act as if it\u2019s a tough taskmaster, this life\/consciousness\/existence thingy, as it sits around evaluating if we're worthy of waking up in the morning.<br><br>When actually, if we're going to believe that the question&nbsp;<em>What's the point<\/em>? makes any sense, we have to believe that existence is inadequate and in need of humans\u2019 help.

A perfectly good iteration of consciousness.<br><br>And what goes unnoticed is that each of us already contributes a fully unique, one-of-a-kind experience.<br><br>Because nothing alive is an exact replica of any other alive thing. There are no living duplicates. Even twins, blades of grass, animals, and microorganisms, have differences and vary one from the next.
