Herewith, something that on initial glance might even seem frivolous.<br><br>Which may not mean it is<em> actually<\/em> frivolous, or less worthy of consideration.<br><br>After all, The Mind-Tickler is about integrating all the woo-woo understanding and questing so many have been aiming for, with the actual practicalities of everyday human life.<br><br>Because really when it comes down to it, what good is all that seeking and realizating and OM-ing and Aha-ing, if it separates us from life? We can\u2019t all live non-stop in a cave on a mountaintop. At some point we have to live these lives.<br><br>So maybe there's value in a bit of light-weight non-profundity offering a little breathing space while also bringing yummy treats.<br><br>So today let\u2019s play with language. Specifically, the word \u201clike.\u201d Specifically how the word \u201clike\u201d is like, inserted into, like, every where.<br><br>See? Frivolous. Hopefully you\u2019ll bear with your friendly Mind-Tickler.<br><br>Because in languages all over the world<em> (*see below if you care)<\/em>, people are throwing \u201clike\u201d into their sentences willy nilly.<br><br>What\u2019s up with that?<br><br>Of course you have wondered and spent many a sleepless night, like, pondering.<br><br>Experts tell us \u201clike\u201d is just filler, a placeholder.<br><br>But what do we need filler for? What are we holding a place for?<br><br>We\u2019re also told it\u2019s meaningless. Though if that were the case, then we could just as well substitute other words, like, say, \u201cbuzzsaw\u201d or \u201cfruitcake,\u201d for just as effective filler as \u201clike.\u201d<br><br>Fruitcake, why not, buzzsaw, substitute any other word?<br><br>No. \u201cLike\u201d it is. Of all the possible words, it has to be \u201clike.\u201d<br><br>It seems \u201clike\u201d serves some purpose the language folks, like, haven\u2019t noticed.<br><br>So let\u2019s go to the dictionary shall we?<br><br>\u201cLike\u201d means many things, all of which can be mighty interesting from a non-dual perspective. For today let\u2019s notice that in addition to those, \u201clike\u201d means\u2026<br><br><em>As if, similar to, approximating.<\/em> \u201cLike\u201d means resembling an object but not being the object. \u201cLike\u201d means nearly the same but not the same.<br><br>\u201cLike\u201d indicates exaggeration, approximation of the real, illusion, lie.<br><br>Not literal, not true, not real.<br><br>Well, look at that.<br><br>\u201cLike\u201d is a tell, as in poker.<br><br>\u201cI stayed up till, like, 3am\u201d is pretty surely an indicator of exaggeration. \u201cI feel like I can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d reveals that I can, in actuality, take it. \u201cIt\u2019s like, who cares what they think\u201d indicates caring very much what they think. \u201cI need to, like, borrow money\u201d indicates that money is unlikely to be repaid.<br><br>\u201dHe\u2019s not acting like himself,\u201d and \u201cI feel like myself again\u201d pretend that the \u201cself\u201d is, like, anything real at all.<br><br>The word \u201clike\u201d very often comes just before the as-if, the exaggeration, the not real.<br><br>The word \u201clike\u201d points to the not real.<br><br>Well. Who knew?<br><br>Wouldn\u2019t it be something if, all along, we have had an indicator, an exposer of the truth\u2026 right there in our everyday sentences, not even bothering to hide\u2026<br><br>That we are not a self, we are not a real thing, we are not what we appear to be, and<br><em><br>we have always known it.<\/em><br><br>Our language shows that this self business is a barely disguised fraud.<br><br>Even more amazing, once we pay attention to likes, we discover that we actually speak the truth, in a literal \u201csimply not capable of lying\u201d kind of way,<br><br>Always.<br><br>We can't lie about the illusion. There is always a tell.<br><br>Turns out whatever it is we really are has a ferocious, ever-present insistence on integrity.<br><br>So it allows the \u201clike\u201d lie while at the same time, making sure to point to the truth.<br><br>\u201cLikes\u201d and \u201cfeels likes\u201d and \u201cseems likes\u201d are falsehoods which keep us honest.<br><br>We just haven't noticed.<br><br>In the spiritual world, we often hear about the limitations of language. But it turns out that it's through that language, through \u201clike\u201d and other words,<br><br>that existence actually reveals, actually shows us\u2026<br><br>what we know but don\u2019t know we know, what we are while pretending to be what we are not.<br><br>Through that limiting language. Through those words we brush aside as limited or inadequate or meaningless filler.<br><br>All of which is great, like, news.<br><br>Because it means we can continue to play-act being individuals, continue to pretend it\u2019s possible to act like ourselves, continue to pretend to be, like, an authentic self at all.<br><br>While all along, still, also, acknowledging the actual anyway.<br><br>Which is, like, really cool.<br><br>And which also helps us see that<br><br>there\u2019s truly nothing else we can actually,<br><br>like,<br><br>Do.<br><br>And that there's truly nothing else that is actually,<br><br>like,<br><br>frivolous.<br><br><br><em>*English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, Mandarin, Armenian, Hebrew, Hindi, Bengali, Czech, Filipino, Finnish, Russian, and more.<\/em><br><br>Click to get your Mind-Tickled every week: <a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\">http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v<\/a><br>Click here to see Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump:  <a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/JudyCohenBatgap\">https:\/\/bit.ly\/JudyCohenBatgap<\/a><br><br><img src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/f3872ed8-16b1-40d2-9885-a9ecbe8fd005.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width: 15.43%;\"><br>","extra":"","extra2":""}
