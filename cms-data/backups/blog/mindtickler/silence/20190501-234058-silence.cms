The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.\" &nbsp;--Lao Tzu<\/em><br><br>Most of us know that the mind keeps babbling a steady nonstop stream of words.<br><br>Perhaps that\u2019s one reason why silence is so highly esteemed in the non-dual world. &nbsp;<br><br>And yet weirdly, so many teachers and wanna-be teachers go on... <br><br>and on...<br><br>and on...<br><br>about everything, including silence.<br><br>Every day a new 38-paragraph discourse.<br><br>So. Many. Words.<br><br>Isn't it weird that many exhorters who tell us, \u201c<em>Remain silent<\/em>,\u201d have so dang much to say? <br><br>As if, if they just keep typing, they might drag their readers into enlightenment by sheer exhaustion, wearing us down syllable by syllable.<br><br>Or as if, if they just keep typing, readers might be fooled into thinking there\u2019s something in all those words. <br><br>Instead of <em>nothing<\/em> in all those words. &nbsp;About silence.<br><br>Maybe some of these Sages might try taking their own advice. If only because long treatises are pretty much contradictory to what they\u2019re supposedly espousing. <br><br>So when they go on and on, maybe they're revealing that they don't have themselves that which they\u2019re trying to sell.<br><br>Since anything truly understood can probably be said concisely.<br><br>Meanwhile all that wordiness is like a curtain. What\u2019s behind it is still there. But the curtain may well block the view.<br><br>Which is why, if what we\u2019re after is enlightenment, words are not helpful. They obscure. They obstruct. They deceive. Language is dualistic- &nbsp;separating from experience.<br><br>So it's possible that silence, realization, enlightenment, may not be transmittable, or attainable, via words.<br><br>Though of course we can\u2019t do without language at this point in our species\u2019 evolution. We wouldn't even want to; we need it.<br><br>But when we\u2019re talking about consciousness or awareness or enlightenment, we might have a very different experience\u2026<br><br>If only we could just zip it for a while. <br><br>Because all those words anchor down the self.<br><br>After all, if mental, written and oral descriptions could be set aside, what might be left? <br><br>If we could feel without describing, act without analysis, experience without evaluating good or bad\u2026<br><br>Without all the blah-blah of <em>what I\u2019m thinking<\/em> and <em>what I\u2019m feeling<\/em> and <em>what should happen<\/em> and <em>what is right or wrong<\/em>\u2026 <br><br>What would happen to the sense of self? <br><br>Would there be a center-point, an I, a Me, a You, without words?<br><br><em>How would we know? <\/em><br><br>And therein lies something many Mind-Tickler readers have been looking for, for a very long time.<br><br>So if enlightenment is wanted, we might try setting the words aside once in a while. <br><br>All of them.<br><br>We might try experiencing without talking <em>about<\/em> it.<br><br>Even to ourselves.
