You wouldn't mind more understanding and knowing what you are or are not.<br><br>Perhaps you're certain that the right way is to be ok with everything as it is, but still, the imperfect, does-things-wrong self could use a bit of polishing up.<br><br>You want tools to make that happen.<br><br>Otherwise why bother with all those podcasts, therapies, inquiries, meditations, satsangs, and spiritual self-improvement books.<br><br>Why give a damn about free will, enlightenment, past traumas, or understanding past conditioning. Why care what consciousness is and where one's place is in it. Why care what the \u201cpoint\u201d is, either.<br><br>What\u2019s all that interest&nbsp;for, if not to improve, to feel more right and more complete.<br><br>After all, inadequacy, the sense of something missing, the sense of not good enough, the sense of \u201cnot there yet,\u201d is build into the system of being a self.<br><br>There\u2019s no way to be a person and feel complete. Since humans are not by any means all there is.<br><br>So the feeling of missing something, needing something, and not being enough is pretty much guaranteed.<br><br>Of course, you could just accept and get used to not ok-as-is. But you'd rather correct it, be a better person, feel good enough, and maybe even wake up while you're at it.<br><br>Which is fine. This is as good a way to spend a life, and experience, and be, as any other.<br><br>Since even seeking is included in the consciousness experience.<br><br>So in the interests of fun, since you\u2019re going to improve and seek anyway, let's explore a few common obstacle-thoughts that might get in the way.<br><br>Not because they\u2019re bad. Just because they are effectively diverting from where you say you want to go. And also because, why not.<br><br>In no particular order:<br><br><strong>1- I already know this - or- I\u2019ve heard this before.<\/strong><br>Let\u2019s say this is true. So what? Isn't it irrelevant? Can these delicate ears only take in unrepeated info which has never been encountered before? Where\u2019s the problem in considering something again? Not to mention it\u2019s more likely that it's parroted and someone else\u2019s, not yours, anyway. So can you consider it anew?<br><br><strong>2- I should be farther along than this- I should know this by now.<\/strong><br>Why? Simply because you read it before, however many times? How does that become a rule for how \u201cfar along\u201d you personally should be? And how do you know, what expert keeps the timetable?<br><br><strong>3- This won\u2019t help me\/do anything to change things.<\/strong><br>As if thought knows, in advance, what will help you. Let\u2019s face it, if this was true, why hasn\u2019t thought stepped up already and taken care of things? What\u2019s it waiting for? Could it be it actually has no idea what will or won't help?<br><br>And when evaluation of success or failure happens before you even try, there\u2019s only one possible result, which just happens to confirm this thought.<br><br>If there\u2019s a thought saying, \u201cI&nbsp;know this won\u2019t work because I\u2019ve tried it before,\u201d consider the possibility that even then, this thought was running and you have never, in actuality, tried before. Where's the harm in trying again?<br><br><strong>4- What can I do with this info?<\/strong><br>If while you\u2019re experiencing something, you\u2019re trying to figure out how you can make use of it later, you\u2019re not really taking it in, you\u2019re strategizing before even fully getting the thing you\u2019re hoping to use.&nbsp;It doesn\u2019t matter what you&nbsp;do. Leave the doing to whatever is in charge of that.<br><br><strong>5- Others don\u2019t have this problem.<\/strong><br>Can you ever be certain that what others say and show you is all there is? Interesting how effectively and conveniently this comparison confirms your own inadequacy.<br><br><strong>6- No one else has it this bad- no one understands me.<\/strong><br>Yes because you\u2019re so complicated, and so special, so off-the-charts messed-up, that only you are, or can ever be, the problem. Only you, alone in the universe in your badness. That sounds exactly like how existence and consciousness works, right?<em> (sarcasm)<\/em><br><br><strong>7- This is what I believe\/ I don\u2019t believe this.<\/strong><br>When considering something new, does it matter what you believe already? How can anything new get past this? Maybe you don\u2019t have to believe in order to consider something else. Maybe you can look at it, consider, and throw it away later if you still want to.<br><br><strong>8- What\u2019s the point?<\/strong><br>Ah yes, mind\u2019s favorite last resort. What wants and needs a point in order to think about something in a new way? What needs to have a point at all, in order to exist?<br><br>So there you go. A few thoughts to play with.<br><br>For fun. For novelty. For curiosity.<br><br>Do you have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something with them, get somewhere with them?<br><br>Of course not.<br><br>The self's imperfections, and not-getting-its, and wanting something differents, and inadequacies will continue, regardless.<br><br>Nothing wrong with that.<br><br>Nothing wrong either, though,<br><br>with looking at obstacles in a new way,<br><br>and maybe even occasionally<br><br>getting<br><br>what you want.<br><br>Because it could just be that<br><br>there's no obstacle<br><br>even to that.<br><br><br>","extra":"","extra2":""}
