By no more than this instruction, the fortunate one attains tranquility.\"<br>--Ashtavakra Gita<br><br>----------<br><br>\u201cYou don't want to be an ordinary person. That is really the problem. It is the most difficult thing to be an ordinary person. Culture demands you must be something other than what you are. That has created a certain momentum -- a tremendous, powerful movement of thought. That's all that it is. Otherwise it has no use.\u201d<br>--UG Krishnamurti<br><br>----------<br><br>\u201cAnything you want to achieve is a self-centered activity.\u201d<br>--J. Krishnamurti<\/em><br><br><br><br>In my work, things often come in waves, and lately there\u2019s been a renewed influx of clients whose favorite pain is, \u201cI haven\u2019t reached my full potential.

The&nbsp;<em>BEST<\/em>&nbsp;potential.<br><br>Because it\u2019s not enough, if we\u2019re smart or talented, to only get a nice little job and be an average weekend-enjoying person supporting a family and doing just enough to have an ordinary life.<br><br>No. We have to have the whole sparkling enchilada or none of it is good enough.<br><br>Ordinary equals failure.<br><br>And why? All because some teacher somewhere long ago, or some parent convinced that only greatness will do for their little one, told us we were special and that it was important-<br><br><em>required, <\/em>even,<br><br>to turn talent into something. Grades, money, awards, acclaim, fame, fancy titles.<br><br>Something. Get to it.<br><br>Never mind that so many kids hear this same story that it\u2019s commonplace.<br><br>In fact, since almost no one else reaches their Full Potential either, then<em> not r<\/em>eaching that pinnacle is actually the norm. It\u2019s as ordinary as breathing.<br><br>Y'know- the opposite of special.<br><br>Still the non-Full-Achiever suffers, thinking they alone are failing.<br><br>There\u2019s only one little problem with this set-up for misery.<br><br>Potential, full or otherwise, does not exist.<br><br>It\u2019s a humans-made-it-up concept which helps no one and ruins perfectly good lives.<br><br>Potential is a story of how life should be&nbsp;<em>someday,<\/em>&nbsp;an idealized dream, a fantasy future which never actually arrives.<br><br>It\u2019s the opposite of presence, the opposite of&nbsp;<em>Be Here Now<\/em>,&nbsp;the opposite of&nbsp;<em>This Is It.<\/em><br><br>Instead, Potential is later, it\u2019s future, it\u2019s imagination. Potential is, \u201cLet\u2019s watch a mental movie of a great someday life and then beat ourselves up for not living up to that fiction.\u201d<br><br>Can you say, \u201cHorror movie,\u201d boys and girls?<br><br>And the thing is, it\u2019s not even our fantasy. It\u2019s someone else\u2019s, and we, in our innocence, take it on.<br><br>Some earnest teacher says, \u201cThis is how you\u2019re supposed to live, this is what you\u2019re capable of, and you must do what you\u2019re capable of.\u201d<br><br>And not knowing we can question whether capability must actually equal requirement, we believe them.<br><br>We adopt <em>their <\/em>standard, <em>their <\/em>dream, and then torture ourselves with<em> our<\/em> inadequacy for the rest of time.<br><br>Whole lives evaluated and measured against someone else\u2019s dream.<br><br>Ouch.<br><br>The wild thing too, which most of us ordinary non-achievers would have no way of knowing, is that when those rare and special few actually do reach Full Potential-<br><br>the Madonnas and Steve Jobs and Kurt Cobains and Simone Biles and Anthony Bourdains and Nobel Prize winners-<br><br>Full Potential turns out to be<br><br>not enough.<br><br>Because look closely and we discover that those \"successful\" folks are also anxious and inadequate and unhappy.
