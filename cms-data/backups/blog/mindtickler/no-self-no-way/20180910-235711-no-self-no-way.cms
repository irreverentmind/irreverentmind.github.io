Maybe you\u2019re even one of them.<br><br>If so, the Mind-Tickler offers apologies right now for the unintentional rise in blood pressure that could be about to follow.<br><br>Because suggest, \u201cThere is no self,\u201d and people start saying things like, \u201cOh yeah, smarty pants? Well, go stand in front of a bus and see what happens to your no-self then!\u201d<br><br>Or they start talking in indignant tones about their \u201cpersonal experience\u201d.<br><br>As if personal experience ever proves truth. As if how we experience things, how we think about things, could never just be\u2026<br><br>some wildly skewed point of view.<br><br>Yes, tell people they\u2019re separate individuals and everyone nods with satisfaction. Say, \u201cYou\u2019re not what you think you are,\u201d and grrrr.<br><br>Which is mighty weird if you think about it.<br><br>Because setting aside for a moment all the opinions about right, wrong, and what is or isn\u2019t true\u2026<br><br>What exactly is so upsetting about this kind of statement? What in the words, \u201cThere is no self,\u201d warrants anger, un-friending, blocking, and mockery?<br><br>I mean if one is so sure there\u2019s a self, why get all riled if someone says otherwise? &nbsp;True is true, right? Who cares if others know it?<br><br>It\u2019s enough to make a curious person wonder\u2026<br><br>What is alarmed by this \u201cno separate self\u201d observation?<br><br>What insists, \u201cNo no no! There most definitely is a self and it\u2019s right here. Shut up!\u201d<br><br>Hmmm.<br><br>Mighty prickly and easily threatened, that sense-of-self thingy.<br><br>It\u2019s funny too, because... is life better with the story, \u201cI am me, a separate individual?\"<br><br>Is that peaceful?<br><br>Oh hell no.<br><br>Individual selves suffer. Individual selves are lonely, dissatisfied, incomplete and inadequate. &nbsp;Individual selves come with the need to fix flaws, de-tress, get other selves to love and approval of them, and get enlightened.<br><br>(Never mind that nothing that\u2019s already light has any need of enlightenment.)<br><br>Sheesh.<br><br>Who in their right mind would fight so hard to keep all that?<br><br>Meanwhile, just for something different, we might feel into the possibility of \u201cno self\u201d for a moment and just explore \u2013<br><br>Whatever \u201cno-self\u201d is\u2026 does it get angry? Need protecting? Lack love? Care about if it\u2019s seen or known or understood?<br><br>Nah.<br><br>Much lighter, that. Freer, calmer, diffuse, clear.<br><br>Why not choose that, if only for the peace in it? &nbsp;Rather than fighting so hard for something that feels so bad?<br><br>And then for fun, we might also see if we can point to what needs to jump in so quickly to protect this precious story of self. &nbsp;<br><br>Literally- point to it.<br><br>See if we can find what real thing is afraid of any oncoming bus or opinions or words or nothingness.<br><br>See if the body- arms, legs, skin, heart, brain matter- cares at all about words, let alone ones that say, \"There is no self.\" &nbsp;<br><br>I mean, given all the absolute certainty, shouldn't this be very easy to point to and locate?<br><br>So that if we don't find the self, perhaps we can at least open to the possibility that it isn't there.<br><br>Or anywhere.<br><br>Which just might leave us with the relief of nothing to do and nothing to fix.<br><br>And if we do somehow find that fragile little thing\u2026<br><br>Perhaps, just for sanity, we can set it aside for a while.<br><br>Not because there\u2019s anything wrong with it.<br><br>But because it hurts.<br><br>And maybe, just maybe\u2026<br><br>After years, decades, millennia...<br><br>We\u2019ve had enough of that.<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click to get in on the Mind-Tickler every week<\/a><br>","extra":""}
