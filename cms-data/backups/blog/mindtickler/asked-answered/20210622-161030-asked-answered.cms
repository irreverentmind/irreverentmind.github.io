I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019m auditioning.<br><br>I reply, \u201cI have nothing for you.\u201d<br><br>He doesn\u2019t catch the plural meanings and dismisses me promptly.<br><br>He\u2019s annoyed that I don\u2019t tell my surely-fabulous enlightenment story, don\u2019t expound on what life is like now that I\u2019m wise, don\u2019t take vast chunks out of my life to devote to filling a stranger in on the great secrets that worked for me.<br><br>He\u2019s annoyed that I feel no obligation to answer simply because he asks. &nbsp;<br><br>Rude.<br><br>And spared.<br><br>Meanwhile, apparently everyone else he asked- every one of those important and less-important leaders in spirituality- &nbsp;answered his demanding questions.<br><br>So eager they apparently all are to present themselves as having wisdom, and to tell how they see things.<br><br>I don\u2019t get it.<br><br>I don\u2019t get the tradition of seekers asking questions of teachers.<br><br>I don\u2019t get the value of satsang, where people ask wise ones how things are.<br><br>I don\u2019t get spiritual leaders expounding on their origin story, their lineage, or how to see the world and awareness and consciousness, according to that person.<br><br>I don\u2019t get collecting sages\u2019 answers, like my new buddy is doing.<br><br>What I especially don\u2019t get, is why so-called teachers, answer.<br><br>Because exactly whom does it help for answerers to do all the work for the askers?<br><br>Do teachers think no one but themselves can find their own way? Are askers too feeble-minded to answer their own questions?<br><br>And of course, these wise answers can\u2019t be understood more than intellectually anyway.<br><br>Because they\u2019re someone else\u2019s.<br><br>Seekers want answers. As long as someone else gives them.<br><br>They hand over their agency, sit back and wait to be told how it is.<br><br>How easy to become prey to grifters this way.<br><br>Why is anyone being asked to carry them?<br><br>And why are teachers so eager to do so?<br><br>Besides, have seekers not noticed that teacher don't all give the same answers?<br><br>Some go through the dark night of the soul, some are suddenly touched with magic, some claim to experience bliss forever, some get it and lose it, some are terrified, some lose the sense of purpose and stew in, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point.\u201d &nbsp;<br><br>It seems consciousness does not find one perfect awakening experience and then pump out replicas and stop being so infinitely creative from here on out.<br><br>Which means, despite everyone\u2019s certainty that their way is THE way, experience is completely individual and variable.<br><br>So seekers may as well find their own. Since that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be regardless.<br><br>So. You\u2019re a seeker and you want answers?<br><br>ASK YOU.<br><br>Ask and wait. Ask and answer.<br><br>Be extremely literal. Be extremely rigorous. Don\u2019t settle for BS non-answers like, \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m right here,\u201d with your hand waving aimlessly in the space 6 inches in front of your forehead.<br><br>Where, exactly? Point to it. Literally.<br><br>Locate. Is it the forehead, the brain, the body in the chair?<br><br>Do bodies- elbows, earlobes, skin- send ideas in the middle of the night, when you\u2019re lying half-asleep in bed?<br><br>And that highly-touted sense of self- what knows it\u2019s there? Where exactly is this knower?<br><br>Specifically.<br><br>Ask, \u201cWhat actually knows this answer, and how does it know?\u201d<br><br>Ask, \u201cIs this a theory or something I can prove?\u201d<br><br>Ask, \u201cWhere is my proof, other than that I think it, or other than that some teacher said it? How do I know this?\u201d<br><br>Accept no vagueness, and you'll probably eliminate answers like, \u201cIt\u2019s light. It\u2019s energy. It\u2019s brain, heart, a feeling, awareness.\u201d<br><br>Find proof. Find what cares.<br><br>Then maybe you can move on to your next answers.<br><br>Yours.<br><br>Not Krishnamurti\u2019s. Not Byron Katie\u2019s. Not Rupert \/ Robert \/ Tony \/ Ramana \/ or Nisargadatta\u2019s.<br><br>Certainly not mine. Because no amount of me or anyone else saying, \u201cThis is how it is,\u201d<br><br>Is actually<br><br>How it is.<br><br>And once your own answers come,<br><br>you may find you don't care what anyone else\u2019s are.<br><br>Making \"seeking\"<br><br>a no-thing.<br><br>-------------<br><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/a><\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br><\/a><br><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&t=6s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Watch Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump<\/a><\/strong><br>-----------<br><br><em>\"You seek the path?
