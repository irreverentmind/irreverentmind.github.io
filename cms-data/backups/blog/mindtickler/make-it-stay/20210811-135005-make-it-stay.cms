To \"have\" running water you must let go of it and let it run. The same is true of life.\"<br>--Alan Watts<br><br>----------<br><br>\"Already your mind\u2019s saying, \u201cYes, but come on \u2026 what about the levels of enlightenment and what about my emotional blocks, and what about my chakras, they\u2019re not all fully open? What about my stillness \u2013 I\u2019m not really still yet, and what about my ego? It\u2019s a bit reduced but it\u2019s still there.\u201d<br>--Tony Parsons<br><\/em><br>----------------<br><br>Hopeful client: <em>I am no longer seeking. I see that this is it. I just need your help seeing this from different angles so that my mind doesn't take me away from present reality again and pull me back into thinking.<\/em><br><br>Most spiritually-inclined folks are pretty certain there\u2019s something to get. and then, once gotten, it has to be held onto.<br><br>A person can get there and then, can\/should\/must stay there.<br><br>Of course anyone can be forgiven for thinking any of that, especially since it seems to be the message from so many teachers, memes, and opinionated online posts.<br><br>Interestingly though, there\u2019s a common experience many people describe when they have a \u201choly crap\u201d spiritual-type event.<br><br>Quite often they describe a sense of sliding, a feeling of scrambling on vertical glass, of no gripper and also no grip.<br><br>For a moment it is clear that there\u2019s nothing to hold onto.<br><br>And then almost instantly, all these same folks want to do is hold on to that realization, that understanding.<br><br>Permanently. As in, forever.<br><br>They want to grip the ungrippable. They want to never let it go.<br><br>\u201cWhoo hoo I got it! This is it! Now how do I keep it?\u201d<br><br>Oh the pain of contradiction, dissatisfaction, and perpetual seeking inherent in this particular confusion.<br><br>Because asking any version of, \u201cHow do I stay here?\u201d such as, <em>How do I keep thought from grabbing me again? Or, How do I keep my awareness of awareness? Or, How do I keep this bliss, this \u201cnot minding what happens\u201d state?<\/em><br><br>is a hopeless, failure-guaranteed goal.<br><br>First, because here on planet earth, nothing stays.<br><br>Weather changes minute by minute, rivers change direction, earth\u2019s axis and magnetic poles shift. Creatures are alive and then dead. Skin cells, hair, athletic ability, ideas, thoughts, moods, feelings- all come and go, all here then gone. &nbsp;<br><br>Why would we think some spiritual understanding, or a grasp of awareness, or some clarity of thought, is supposed to be the exception to that very clear Earth-rule?<br><br>How is it reasonable to think we\u2019re supposed to grasp something and keep it grasped forever?<br><br>Especially when our alive-human biology makes \u201cholding onto\u201d anything, even awareness, flat-out impossible.<br><br>Because it\u2019s the brain which enables us to experience anything, including awareness.<br><br>Humans can\u2019t do a single thing without the brain. That would be called \u201cvegetative state.\u201d<br><br>Without the brain, we can\u2019t think, we can\u2019t feel, we can\u2019t meditate or zone out, we can\u2019t experience bliss or consciousness, and we can\u2019t \u201cattain enlightenment\u201d.<br><br>It is not possible to be alive and transcend the brain.<br><br>Which means humans are always limited by its capabilities.<br><br>Which means the grand spiritual experience so many folks are chasing happens within the limits of the small piece of meat in our heads.<br><br>And as it happens, that meat, developed after many millions of years of evolution and species survival, does not do sameness. That meat looks for and requires difference, it requires change, it requires movement. (<em>There\u2019s tons and tons of science on this.)<\/em><br><br>The brain sees a clear blue sky and instantly turns attention to the one cloud or the one bird or the one plane moving within all that clear empty space.<br><br>If nothing happens to be moving or appearing in the clear sky, then its attention simply wanders elsewhere.<br><br>The brain can\u2019t stay focused on emptiness for more than a second or two.<br><br>It literally cannot.<br><br>So good luck to any seeker trying to make nothingness, or sameness, or some dearly-loved experience, stay forever. &nbsp;<br><br>Besides, trying to regain or attain or hold onto that sliding nothingness actually makes the sense of self, the one to whom this is happening, more solid, not less. More something, not nothing.<br><br>So finally we might get that chance to experience that long-awaited, long-desired moment of nothingness and then boom, the mind promptly obliterates that emptiness by placing the <em>ME<\/em> squarely in the center of it.<br><br>Bye-bye, scrambling moment of not-there. &nbsp;<br><br>Of course, none of this is to say that the sense of something bigger, the sense of a consciousness which is always there, comes and goes.<br><br>Consciousness may indeed be here always. It may indeed be the one thing that stays.<br><br>And we may even sense this, or feel it, or somehow be absolutely convinced we know this.<br><br>And it may feel like consciousness is ever-present.<br><br>But \u201cfeels like\u201d is not \u201cknowing.\u201d<br><br>And let\u2019s get honest, <em>we do not know. <\/em>And never will.<br><br>Because true knowing also happens within the limited brain.<br><br>What we do know though, is that no one in human history has stayed in that highly-desired awareness of awareness, permanently.<br><br>No one. Not even Ramana. Or Krishnamurti, or Nisargadatta.<br><br>Seeing this can be a great relief.<br><br>Because chasing permanence of any kind is nothing but frustrating.<br><br>And wouldn\u2019t it be lovely to grasp or not grasp, get and then lose, hold and then let go,<br><br>Without rules or impossible demands for anything else.<br><br>Perhaps this is the true This Is It.<br><br>Perhaps this is something worth grasping,<br><br>and worth holding onto,<br><br>Even if only for a moment.<br><br>----------<br><br><em>\"We don't wake up forever. We wake up only now. People have these wonderful experiences of spiritual opening, and that's not it. As soon as they think, \"I want this to last forever,\" they've moved in to a future and lost the reality. This is it, right now. It's that simple.
