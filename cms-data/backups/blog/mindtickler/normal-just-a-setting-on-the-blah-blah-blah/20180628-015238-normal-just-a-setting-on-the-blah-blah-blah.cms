Insignificant, even.<br><br>Yeah, no thanks. We\u2019d much rather be special. Don't be part of the herd! Be the star, shave the head, get the tattoos, be the best, cutest, smartest or most enlightened in the room.<br><br>Except\u2026 not too much different either, please. &nbsp;Not drooling, screaming, setting-things-on-fire, \u201cOMG she\u2019s crazy\u201d different.<br><br>See the confusion?<br><br>Which is it? Do we want normal or special, same or different? Same, but not too much same? Stand out but not too much out?<br><br>Yes!<br><br>See? That clears things right up.<br><br>If we\u2019re paying attention, we might start to notice all the effort to walk the middle line and not veer too much in either direction.<br><br>Which is another way of saying \u201cnormal.\u201d<br><br>Of course this involves careful navigation. Because while no one wants to be insignificant, no one wants to be so significant that they\u2019re alone either.<br><br>Because, well, \u2026 alone. We hate it. Alone is bad, \u2018nkay?<br><br>We\u2019d much rather be part of the greater cluster than a lone nut.<br><br>So here we are, working lifetimes to nurture individuality, while hating being alone, hating being separate, hating being disconnected.<br><br>As if, as individuals, we\u2019ve detached from the whole and spun off into space to die alone, when all we really wanted all along was to be invited to the cosmic party.<br><br>It turns out that much more than specialness, what we really crave is completeness, inclusion, lack of separation.<br><br>We long to disappear into something greater than little ol\u2019 Me.<br><br>Striving for normal is just our mixed-up way of trying to eliminate the sense of separation between our Self and the bigger picture.<br><br>Although it\u2019s kind of funny. Because how is it possible to exist and not be in the picture?<br><br>We keep trying to get back to what we really are.<br><br>As if it\u2019s possible to have left that in the first place, and now have to work hard to return.<br><br>Meanwhile, with the constant focus on how to make the individual stand out- focusing on what it wants, what it likes, what it feels, how it\u2019s doing- &nbsp;well\u2026<br><br>We might not notice what we\u2019re already part of, when all our attention is on trying to be distinctly not part-of.<br><br>Trying to make the individual more individual is fruitless. And not peaceful. And not possible. And causes us to miss the \u201cNo me, only we\u201d essence of existence.<br><br>I mean, imagine watching this planet\u2019s ebbs and flows from far out in space, and see if any one individual is separate and disconnected from the whole. See if, with perspective, it\u2019s possible to find where one person ends and another begins, or if it all moves as a cohesive unit.<br><br>This is good news. Turns out we are already part of a larger completeness. There\u2019s no need to work so hard for connectedness that's already here.<br><br>The individual isn\u2019t so individual after all. No matter how special and unique, or nutty and seemingly alone, we\u2019re still part of something so much bigger.<br><br>And we can\u2019t get more normal than \u201cEverything.\u201d<br><br>That\u2019s the epitome of normal.<br><br>It\u2019s as included as an individual can get.<br><br>Yay!
