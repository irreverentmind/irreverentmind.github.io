You project something ONTO nothing and that's what's fearful..\u201d<br>--Byron Katie<br><br>-----------<br><br>\u201cTo see the separate self clearly is to see its non-existence.\u201d<br>--Rupert Spira<br><br>\u201cWithin a second, the self returns, saying, \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d<br>-- Richard Sylvestor<br><br><br>Recently someone told me about a spiritual writer who had had a big enlightenment experience, experiencing a seeing-through of the self, and then carrying around extreme fear about that for a few years.<br><br>This grandly-enlightened person got a glimpse that they were nothing, after being pretty darned certain for all of their life that they were something.<br><br>As most folks do.<br><br>And understandably that could be felt like a giant loss, like a sort of death. After all, there was a me there, and then\u2026 nothing. Yikes.<br><br>Still, it\u2019s odd, don\u2019t you think? I mean, if this person saw that we\u2019re nothing, then what was afraid?<br><br>Nothing, that\u2019s what.<br><br>Certainly consciousness wasn\u2019t afraid of disappearing.<br><br>Because where would it go- the island of lost selves?<br><br>No, for that author, the thing that was afraid could only have been the self. The one supposedly done away-with.<br><br>Fear was simply a subtle way of validating the me who had lost something.<br><br>Besides, for them to have lost the self, there had to have been a self there in the first place, something which could get lost. And this one went missing. Just up and left.<br><br>All those years that self was there, and all it took was for them to see that it wasn\u2019t there.<br><br>And then boom, self was outta here.<br><br>As if simply their seeing made the difference between self and no self.<br><br>Though of course, if there\u2019s no self, then there's never been one. &nbsp;If we\u2019re nothing, we\u2019ve always been nothing.<br><br>And life has gone on.<br><br>Seeing it, changes nothing.<br><br>Nothing is lost either way.<br><br>Now I realize that for many folks, maybe even you, this type of stuff makes zero sense.<br><br>\u201cOf course there\u2019s a me. I\u2019m right here. Jeez.\u201d<br><br>To those readers I\u2019d just say, if you are something, show it to me.<br><br>Literally show me your self.<br><br>You\u2019re not skin, bones, muscles. You\u2019re not air around a body. You\u2019re not electricity. You\u2019re not light.<br><br>None of those things are a self.<br><br>Those are things or ideas representing, standing-in-for, substituting for, a self.<br><br>A representation isn\u2019t the real thing it represents.<br><br>Ok so, so far we\u2019re finding nothing.<br><br>Which is apparently all we actually are.<br><br>And yet, even so, we may begin to notice the necessity of these bits of nothingness.<br><br>That color- it's happening in our eyeballs.<br><br>No eyeballs, no color.<br><br>The color is us.<br><br>That sound? Happening in our ears. That sensation? Happening in US.<br><br>Like a tree falling in the woods. Making no sound until it\u2019s heard.<br><br>Without us to experience, what is here?<br><br>Turns out all experience goes through the fulcrum of us.<br><br>Making us required, integral, necessary, to the experience of experiencing.<br><br>There is literally nothing without us.<br><br>Because everything is made of us.<br><br>Which makes these self-nothings, not nothing, but everything.<br><br>And that can never be lost.<br><br>Ok so fine, what\u2019s the point?<br><br>Well, us. We are the point. The unique experience of these snowflakes. Everything. Experience. Existence. Us.<br><br>We are the point.<br><br>This is what that spiritual author\u2019s fear obscured, in their newly represented enlightened version of self. (\"This is me, the one who is enlightened and terrified.\")<br><br>It starts to be clear how so many spiritual seekers work so hard and yet can\u2019t find.<br><br>Because nothing can\u2019t find nothing.<br><br>And Everything is already here, completely unhidden, right here in plain sight.<br><br>Where or why would we get busy looking for that which is already here?<br><br>Yes the mind wants to be something. Yes, we don\u2019t want to be nothing.<br><br>And yet nothing is indeed what we are.<br><br>And also, we are everything.<br><br>The circuits may begin to fry at this point.<br><br>Because paradox sometimes does that to a mind that wants straight-line, logical explanations and realizations.<br><br>Still, it\u2019s quite something.<br><br>And also, quite nothing.<br><br>And also, quite<br><br>Everything.<br><br>\u200b<br>\"Being nothing, you are everything.
