{"categories":["spiritual teacher seeker questions answers Years ago a woman on social media asked how she should handle facilitating spiritual inquiry when her clients didn\u2019t follow the rules.  The post got almost a hundred replies","each commenter so eager to tell how they did things","to show off what they knew.    Finally I asked the original poster","\u201cWhat are you currently doing in this situation","what has worked for you?\u201d     Turned out she already knew exactly what to do","and she was already doing it.    Yet she deferred to everyone else\u2019s wisdom.    Fast forward to a couple of months ago","where here at Mind-Tickler headquarters","we discussed how many seekers turn to teachers to give them answers","in satsang","on social media","in retreats and zooms and podcasts. We discussed how","by asking sages for their points of view","folks check their own wisdom at the door.    That Tickler said","in essence","ask yourself rather than hanging on every word or quoting every utterance of some wise one. Because how can surprises happen for you when you\u2019re trying to fit your own experience into someone else\u2019s box?    Since that Tickler","many have written me to ask","\u201cBut how? How do I ask myself?\u201d  They feel caught in the mind\u2019s loops. Their answers don\u2019t seem right","don\u2019t match the gurus\u2019","aren\u2019t liked.   \u201cThe mind is too powerful","\u201d they say.    Now maybe it\u2019s true that the mind","left to itself","goes round and round the same maypole forever. Maybe it\u2019s true that some kind of outside input is necessary in order to be able to step outside the minds\u2019 usual hamster wheel.    Or maybe it\u2019s not.   What is certain though","is that if answers are not found by you","they can never be yours. They\u2019re someone else\u2019s. All you can do is borrow them.   Perhaps part of what has gotten in the way is that you're trying to understand. You want comprehension","you want realizations","you want ahas","rather than seeing or being or experiencing. But understanding is dependent on the mind. Understanding is","by definition","intellectual.    Maybe what is needed","in order to discover different-than-usual answers","is different-than-usual questions.   So today","just for fun","here are a few possibly-new questions to play with.    Let's be clear that they\u2019re not inquiries","not a practice","not a system","not a method","not a way.  They\u2019re just some random questions. Maybe you\u2019ll find them mind-opening.   Note that these questions include no whys or what\u2019s-the-meanings or explanations of how some past trauma brought xyz to happen. That kind of rehashing affirms established conclusions rather than offering something new.   Also","consider bringing these tips as you play with these queries:   \u2022 As mentioned in that previous Tickler","be extremely literal. If you say","\u201cThere\u2019s a sense","\u201d - where? Where is this \u201csense\u201d? Literally point to it. If it doesn\u2019t hold up to literal","then consider the possibility it\u2019s imagined and not actually anywhere.   \u2022 Don\u2019t answer with theory. Theory is still someone else\u2019s answer","pretending to be your own. That\u2019s you trying to do things right","not an actual answer.    \u2022 Also don\u2019t try to make theory prove preconceived beliefs.  \u201cIt\u2019s energy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the mind.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a thought.\u201d What does any of that mean","exactly?    \u2022 Watch for the inclination for debate with yourself","with the questions","with the answers. You don\u2019t have to believe","you don\u2019t have to agree","you don\u2019t have to figure out if the answer that comes is true. If you\u2019re going to evaluate and weigh every answer for whether you agree","it will not be possible for anything new to get past that sieve.   It doesn\u2019t matter if you are right. You won\u2019t be able to tell anyway.    \u2022 Watch for \u201cbuts\u201d and \u201cfeels likes.\u201d Both change the subject and turn your answer right back to where you started. Both are huge contributors to that sense that you\u2019re stuck.   So in no particular order","just for novelty:  1) What if this happening","this personality style","this feeling","this thought","is not my fault or doing?  It's just a WHAT IF. Watch mind insist it\u2019s all your your fault and responsibility. Watch it fight hard to blame and accuse you. Watch it get furious at the idea that everything","good or bad","might not revolve around all-important you.  2) Is it possible that this","as it is","is good enough? Is it possible that I","as I am","am good enough?  This isn\u2019t asking if you like it","or if you\u2019re where you want to be","or if you\u2019re good","or if you\u2019ve \u201cgot it.\u201d This is asking","is it good enough? Can you make do with less than perfect? If not","why not? Is your self too special to be imperfect like everything else?  3) Does existence\/life\/awareness (whatever word works for you) have a problem with me? As I am? Feeling into it","how does life\/awareness\/existence feel about me","no matter how screwed up","or how terrible a person I may be? What does existence feel about me? Are you ever going to know if your answer to this is correct? Of course not. Correctness is not what this question is for.  4) Is this all there is? Try answering YES. Wait out the tantrum","the","\u201cBut I don\u2019t Liiiiike it.\u201d Stay with YES","consider that possibility","and watch what happens.   5) Is this situation important? Literally? Not","\u201cIt\u2019s important to me.\u201d What\u2019s that mean","anyway? Take you out of the equation for a minute and relook- how important is it if you\u2019re not the center of the universe?    6) What would my answers be if \u201cBut\u201d or \u201cFeels like\u201d didn\u2019t exist?   7) How is this situation or feeling being used to define me","to tell me who or what I am? \u201cThis means I am (insert word here)\u2026\u201d Does any situation actually know what you Are? What even cares what you Are? What is so intent on defining what you Are?  8) What if I\u2019m not real even though I\u2019m absolutely positively most definitely certain I am? Rather than all the grand debates about whether I AM or I AM NOT","just consider the possibility that you\u2019re not only not what you think","but that you\u2019re not","at all. What\u2019s that feel like? What happens? Then what? If there\u2019s a big resistance and irritation","what benefits from that?  There are more","and these are a good start just for fun.   Will these questions take you to enlightenment? Well","I\u2019m not sure exactly where that is","but if it means hanging out on some chaise lounge at a mystery beach somewhere","I\u2019m in.    Will these questions get you what you want?    They\u2019re just questions","they\u2019re not a genie.     Do I know what you\u2019ll find?    No.   I know what I found.
