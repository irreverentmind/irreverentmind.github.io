There is true nature. I\u2019m in relationship with consciousness.\"<br><br>And of course my personal favorite: \u201cBecome aware of awareness.\u201d<br><br>Sure. Let\u2019s make the thing that is aware of the thing be aware of being aware of the thing.<br><br>Okay!<br><br>This is what happens when we turn to the mind to figure things out.<br><br>Even though... you can see we\u2019re never going to truly know the answers to any of that, right?<br><br>Because even when we have absolute certainty that we\u2019ve experienced Truth and know the answers\u2026 have we got the answers?<br><br>The mind can only see and understand so much. It is limited by its own capabilities.<br><br>Which is why it can\u2019t understand itself. It isn\u2019t big enough for that job.<br><br>This is a key flaw in all those inquiries, enlightenment methods, attempts to \u201csee beyond\u201d the self, to self improve.<br><br>I mean, we don\u2019t even know what the self is, let alone how to improve it.<br><br>It\u2019s just not possible to know what\u2019s bigger than ourselves. So any claims of understanding are self-serving. In every sense of that very apt expression.<br><br>And no matter how much we may insist, posture and strut about it, when we think we know something... we\u2019re being played the fool by thought.<br><br>Because the mind only pretends to understand. While not the least bit interested in understanding.<br><br>After all, what would happen if thinking was able to truly see how nothing, insignificant, limited and unimportant it really is?<br><br>Yeah, no way thought\u2019s going to be good with that.<br><br>So the only reasonable state is, \u201cI don't know.\u201d<br><br>Because honey, we don\u2019t.<br><br>No matter how articulately anyone expounds their point of view, it remains an opinion.<br><br>So all the blah blah blah about consciousness and \u201cI am\u201d?<br><br>That\u2019s masturbatory nonsense. Just mind playing with itself.<br><br>And yes it may be comforting to think we understand consciousness. But really we're never truly going to be able to do anything but guess. Even though mind loudly insists it knows something.<br><br>Nothing wrong with any of this, of course.<br><br>It\u2019s fine to play with our selves. Nothing wrong with a little self manipulation.<br><br>It's just that we\u2019ll wait forever for that happy ending.<br><br>Silly, unsatisfied little things.<br><br>Aren\u2019t we adorable?<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click to get in on the Mind-Tickler<\/a> every week<br>","extra":""}
