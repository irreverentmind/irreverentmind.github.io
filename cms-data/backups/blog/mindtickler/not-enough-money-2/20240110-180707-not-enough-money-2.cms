Banks<br><br>----------<br><br>\"Since the Universe has no center, you can\u2019t be it.\"<br>Neil deGrasse Tyson<\/em><br><br>--------------------<br><br>Today\u2019s Tickler is brought to you by those in the, \u201cI don\u2019t have enough money\u201d club.<br><br>Which includes&nbsp;you and pretty much&nbsp;everyone else. Very few people think they have enough money. Even the rich think they need more.<br><br>Meanwhile&nbsp;here I am retiring soon with not a lot of savings. Shouldn't I&nbsp;be churning with terror about the future, where\u2019 surely I\u2019ll be homeless on the streets with the ubiquitous shopping cart?<br><br>Maybe. But somehow I\u2019m not.<br><br>Perhaps because my life has provided numerous opportunities to see, over and over, that whether money does or doesn\u2019t come has nothing to do with me.<br><br>I mean, I've done everything right and money simply did not arrive. I've done absolutely nothing and somehow it rained cash.<br><br>The ways of income start to seem pretty darned arbitrary.<br><br>Money does what it wants.<br><br>Income is not tied to humans\u2019 behaviors.<br><br>Just like enlightenment, just like happiness, just like sleep and health and ideas and life itself.<br><br>Okay, okay, I know you don\u2019t believe this. I know you believe, along with everyone else, that income depends on&nbsp;you,&nbsp;and&nbsp;your&nbsp;right or wrong actions, and&nbsp;your&nbsp;hard,&nbsp;smart, work.<br><br>Even though there\u2019s no promise, no guarantee, no straight or even crooked line going directly from effort to results. All you can do is put in energy and time and then hope it pays off.<br><br>Though if it\u2019s not a given that you work hard and money surely follows, then it\u2019s not provable that it was your efforts which brought the moola.<br><br>There might be some correlation, but not causation.<br><br>But never mind all that. You are the center point around which it all revolves. What you do. What you don\u2019t do. What you deserve.<br><br>Because&nbsp;money must be&nbsp;earned.&nbsp;You have to&nbsp;deserve&nbsp;it. Like getting a divine pat on the head from the heavens for good behavior.<br><br>Sadly, when the head pat doesn't come, \u201cI don\u2019t have enough money,\u201d quickly turns into, \u201cI\u2019m not enough, as a person,\u201d<br><br>No-money thoughts invariably lead to \"I AM\" thoughts. \u201cI am a failure, I am a loser, I am lazy, stupid, weak.\u201d<br><br>As in, money and thoughts about it&nbsp;tell you who you&nbsp;are.<br><br>So that now it\u2019s not just income that\u2019s not enough, it\u2019s you, as a person, also.<br><br>Which is your fault too. You you you.<br><br>Conveniently supporting the self\u2019s misguided importance as center of the universe.<br><br>As if money could never come unexpectedly, on its own, deserved or not.&nbsp;Like breath, doing its own thing, also deserved or not.<br><br>I mean, wouldn\u2019t it be a whole other experience&nbsp;if it turned out that income is not actually tied to your good behavior, value, worth?<br><br>Of course, I am aware you don\u2019t believe this either; in fact you\u2019re probably arguing right now, \u201cCome on Judy, this is stupid, money can\u2019t possibly come if I don\u2019t work for it and make it.\u201d<br><br>And maybe that\u2019s true. But maybe it isn\u2019t. I mean, right now I\u2019m sitting here holding a lovely big check that came totally unexpectedly from my mortgage company, and new clients are coming out of the woodwork, without my trying,&nbsp;just as the time arrives&nbsp;to stop accepting them.<br><br>Even so, I\u2019m not saying, \u201cDon\u2019t work. Don\u2019t try to get more.\u201d<br><br>It's just that your usual ways of thinking about money aren\u2019t working.<br><br>So if only to reduce some of the terror about&nbsp;the future,&nbsp;if only to lighten some of the guilt, shame and self-disgust that comes with not having enough money- it might be time for something different.<br><br>Not enough money is hard enough. No need to pile on blame and mean name-calling on top.<br><br>So maybe you can start by noticing what it feels like to consider, \u201cWhat if this money situation is not my fault? What if it\u2019s a flow that has nothing to do with me?\u201d<br><br>You don\u2019t have to believe. It\u2019s just a \u201cWhat if?\u201d<br><br>And then, maybe you could notice whether you're&nbsp;literally ok&nbsp;right now, with whatever money you have.<br><br>Staying present, just for a bit. Staying literal.<br><br>As opposed to imagining and planning for a future which never turns out the expected way anyway, no matter how much planning is done in advance.<br><br>You might also see if, even in the past when things seemed dire, you actually had enough and were ok back then too.<br><br>You may as well notice the enough-ness already present, even though \u201cnot enough\u201d thoughts steal all the attention.<br><br>Because&nbsp;enough&nbsp;is what you&nbsp;want, after all, and it might be already here.<br><br>Which might feel better.<br><br>And then who knows- more money might&nbsp;show up. Or perhaps not.<br><br>Either option might not have anything to do with you.<br><br>And is it possible, even just a little, even just once in a while, to trust existence to take care of you,<br><br>Rather than having to shoulder the entire burden of absolutely everything that happens, yourself?<br><br>Separating self, identity, and your very worth as a person,<br><br>from what money does or doesn\u2019t do.<br><br>Who knows? It could turn out to be an excellent start towards<br><br>being truly rich<br><br>Whether rolling in the bucks or not.<br><br><img align=\"center\" alt=\"\" src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/1704909830533.jpg\" width=\"315.84000000000003\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 26%;\"><br>","extra":"","extra2":""}
