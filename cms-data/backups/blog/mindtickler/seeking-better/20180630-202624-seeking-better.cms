Never!\"<br><br>In your own life perhaps there are also situations and feelings that Are. Not. Acceptable.<br><br>Which is fine.<br><br>Not much fun though, is it?<br><br>Whether it's unwillingness to accept what you look like, or loss of love, or a child's disrespect, or how little money is in the bank...<br><br>there are so many situations that seem like they could and should get better, if only you could figure out how to make that happen.<br><br>The thing is, how long do you want to keep trying?<br><br>So many things to fix and improve. &nbsp;You, others, money, feelings, personal behaviors and qualities.<br><br>How long does it make sense to keep at it; to keep chasing that something better?<br><br>How long is a reasonable amount of time to figure out how to get more money or more friends, a different body, more love, less addiction?<br><br>How long is the right amount of time to work on finally being a less deficient, less reactive, less depressed or anxious, younger, prettier, more successful, improved you?<br><br>Years? Decades? A Lifetime?<br><br>Whadaya say, let's just keep doing \u201cInquiry\u201d for another 20 or 30 years.<br><br>Well, maybe keep at it until you and the world get just right.<br><br>When will it be enough, this fixing others or self or reactions to things; this trying to find \u201cTruth\u201d so that we\u2019re not \u201cstressed\u201d?<br><br>Maybe you've noticed it's a lifetime of dissatisfaction with what\u2019s here; a lifetime of hope, determination, insistence to get what isn\u2019t here.<br><br>So. Does it bring peace?<br><br>Sure, that\u2019s what This-Isn't-Good-Enough brings... \"Peace.\"<br><br>Yeah, that\u2019s it.<br><br>But, what about enlightenment?<br><br>Surely there's no question that once attained, enlightenment will be better than this life you have now.<br><br>Right?<br><br>Surely seeking it is worth decades of dissatisfaction with what you\u2019ve actually got.<br><br>Never mind that despite years of study, listening to teachers preach on YouTube, books read, endless meditation, quotes reposted\u2026. it never seems to arrive.<br><br>Never mind that hunting enlightenment through Now-Is-Not-What-I-Want is simply illogical and impossible.<br><br>No. Instead, focus on the unhappiness that happens when others seem to have something you don\u2019t.<br><br>Yeah, let\u2019s focus on that.<br><br>For years.<br><br>Or maybe you had an awakening for a while. Whoo hoo! It arrived, Yay! And then, Dang! It went away, Boo. (a story clung to by an astonishing number of people). &nbsp;<br><br>OK.<br><br>So how much lifetime seems reasonable to invest in desperate yearning and seeking to get it back?<br><br>What do you think- one year, five years, twenty?<br><br>And even though it may seem like trying to get enlightenment to arrive or return must surely be a worthy quest \u2026<br><br>Is striving to get enlightenment a more valuable pursuit than, say, striving to get money or love or anything else?<br><br>I mean, striving is striving, isn\u2019t it?<br><br>No matter what is being sought.<br><br>As long as chasing is happening, as long as dissatisfaction with what\u2019s present, is happening, it's all the same isn't it?<br><br>So\u2026 does it make sense to devote one\u2019s life to striving for better \u2026anything?<br><br>And then here we are again, back to\u2026\u201dHow long?\u201d<br><br>When does what\u2019s here now become finally good enough?<br><br>When does an intense feeling, or that lack, or this craving, become enough, as it is?<br><br>When do we stop trying to beat ourselves or others or situations into change, into improvement?<br><br>Seriously. When?<br><br>Whether we like a situation or feeling or thought or not, do we never get to finally just say, \u201cOk, this seems to be it, might as well just say yes to it?\u201d<br><br>Or must we fight tooth and nail and resist and insist and yearn and crave and cry with frustration\u2026<br><br>Forever.<br><br>So. Lack of money? Well, ok. &nbsp;Cheating spouse? Sigh. Ok. &nbsp;Still addicted? Yeah, this seems to be the way for now. &nbsp;Pain? Yeah it's tough. And Ok.<br><br>Yes I realize this is alien to even consider. We're not used to it.<br><br>At all.<br><br>In fact, you might very well be saying \"But No! I will not accept this situation! NO!\", right now.<br><br>You might very well be still fighting and sputtering even just reading those words 4 lines above. &nbsp;<br><br>Like my 84 year old friend, fighting fighting fighting her aging body's looks.<br><br>Because though it's spiritually incorrect to admit, the truth is we don\u2019t like What-Is. &nbsp;<br><br>And it's also the truth that it doesn't matter one bit whether we like it or not.<br><br>So if instead, it was somehow magically possible to accept what\u2019s here- you, others, situations- as it is, and not try to better it\u2026<br><br>Well then... what?<br><br>Can you see how completely different that would be?<br><br>How differently What-Is-Already-Here would be experienced, without the constant rejection of it; without the constant trying to improve things?<br><br>Can you see it?<br><br>I\u2019m not saying you should to try fix or change the fixing or changing.<br><br>That would be more improvement going on, just applied to a new subject.<br><br>That's just more of the same.<br><br>I\u2019m just saying maybe it\u2019s possible to simply notice, over and over, all the ways we strive for improving, bettering and fixing.<br><br>And then you might be able to discover and focus on what\u2019s actually here, instead of what\u2019s not.<br><br>Because who knows what might happen with that dramatic focus shift.<br><br>Could be nothing.<br><br>Could be everything.<br><br>Might be fun to find out.<br><br>For a change.<br><br>","extra":""}
