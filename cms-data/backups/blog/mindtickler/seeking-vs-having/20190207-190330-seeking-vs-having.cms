Or you\u2019re lacking confidence, or enlightenment, or discipline, procrastinating, unmotivated, overwhelmed. Or you\u2019re depressed, panicky, over-indulging, lonely. Or health\u2019s not good, or sleep doesn't come.<br><br>Yikes.<br><br>So are you okay?<br><br>Well, do any of these experiences equal literal not-okay-ness?<br><br>Is feeling not-okay the same as being not-okay?<br><br>Beginning to notice all the focus on lack\u2026lack of money, lack of love, lack of health, lack of safety, lack of enlightenment\u2026<br><br>Our focus is constantly on what isn\u2019t. There's a constant ignoring or discounting of what is.<br><br>I mean, forget about loving what is; we flat out don't notice what is at all.<br><br>Thought\u2019s focus has almost no interest in what we do have, what is safe, what is enough.<br><br>So not surprisingly we dont see any of that, while focused on how we feeeeel.<br><br>I mean, look at the actual situation in this moment.<br><br>Here\u2019s the internet, the lap to put the laptop on, air, lungs that breathe it, chair to sit in, gravity holding the butt to the chair. &nbsp;<br><br>Thoughts are running. Opinions about thoughts are running. Feelings are happening.<br><br>Yep.<br><br>Not much actually going on in this present moment.<br><br>Sensations. Thoughts.<br><br>Which might even be screaming, \u201cNo! Look out! Trouble coming! Could Happen!\u201d<br><br>And yet, here we are. Person in chair. Safe. Okay.<br><br>Doesn\u2019t that deserve some attention?<br><br>We\u2019ve been ignoring okayness while busily trying to get okay instead.<br><br>Disregarding what is here, and fretting about what isn\u2019t here, while saying we desperately want to get\u2026<br><br>What\u2019s here.<br><br>Um... what?<br><br>Welcome to one of the ways many seekers get stuck perpetually seeking.<br><br>Striving, yearning, reading, satsanging, inquiring\u2026 to get what we already have.<br><br>It\u2019s like we\u2019re out on the front porch calling\u2026<br><br>\u201cYoohooo! Enlightenmennntt! Peeeeace! Contennnntmennt! Okayness! Where are youoooo? Come home!\"<br><br>And like a puppy at our feet, it's wagging, \u201cI\u2019m here! Right here! Look I\u2019m here!\u201d<br><br>And still we\u2019re looking out into the night, calling.<br><br>Yet of course if it\u2019s anywhere, enlightenment is in the present. It's not out in the future somewhere, waiting for us to get our act together and be a more perfected someone or something else, in a better life situation, later.<br><br>That\u2019s no one\u2019s brand of enlightenment.<br><br>So instead, if only because, why not...<br><br>we might notice the actual (not thought-about) present.<br><br>We might notice that we already have what we're seeking. &nbsp;That in the present moment we are safe and oaky.<br><br>And that we already are in the present moment.<br><br>Because truly...<br><br>Really truly...<br><br>Where else can we be?<br><br><br><em>\"If I did not think about tomorrow, there would be no fear, I would not know the future, I would not even care.
