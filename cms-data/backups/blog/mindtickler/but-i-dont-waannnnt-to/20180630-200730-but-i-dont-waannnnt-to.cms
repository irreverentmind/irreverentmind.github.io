The inner voice might say something like, \u201cWho do you think you are? You're so full of yourself to think you have what it takes to write a book, or start a business.\u201d<br><br>It might mean you are out of your depth, not smart enough, in over your head with something you\u2019re not good enough to accomplish.<br><br>And of course, other people could think something about you that you don\u2019t like.<br><br>Yeah. Better just sit there.<br><br>And you might also notice all the struggle for control- control of what you do, what you think, how you do it.<br><br>But do you actually have that control?<br><br>Do your attempts to boss yourself around succeed in getting you off the couch?<br><br>You're still sitting there, aren't you?<br><br>Maybe you\u2019re not in charge of this. &nbsp;Maybe whether you act or not is not up to you.<br><br>What if it\u2019s not your fault or doing that you can\u2019t get things done? &nbsp;What if it\u2019s a happening that\u2019s out of your hands?<br><br>I know that might seem crazy to the inner voice that says, \u201cWell I have to be in control! Otherwise Nothing Will Get Done!\u201d<br><br>But it\u2019s not getting done already, right? Even with the inner voice yelling at you nonstop.<br><br>That voice simply hasn\u2019t noticed it has no power.<br><br>So what would it feel like if you could see that you\u2019re a passenger, not the driver?<br><br>What if non-doing is not your doing?<br><br>What if it's not your fault?<br><br>Well, then, maybe then you can give yourself a break.<br><br>And shockingly, relaxing responsibility you don\u2019t really have anyway, might just relax all that fear of not knowing how.<br><br>Because it's terrifying to think you're supposed to know how to be boss of something you\u2019re not actually boss of.<br><br>So maybe that relaxing is just enough to open the door to peace.<br><br>And then things might just begin to get done. &nbsp;Without you.<br><br>Wouldn\u2019t that be something?<br>","extra":""}
