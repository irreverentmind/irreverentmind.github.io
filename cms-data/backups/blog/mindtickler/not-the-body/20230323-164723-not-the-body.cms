You are all shiny with realization.<br> <br>For however long, it\u2019s quite clear that you are not the body.<br> <br>And then\u2026 what\u2019s this?<br><br>Depression, fear, panic, what\u2019s-the point, no motivation, why get out of bed, it\u2019s all nothing anyway. <br> <br>An inexorable slide into\u2026 feelings. <br> <br>Bad feelings, hard feelings, intense feelings. Dark night of the soul feelings. Life-crushing terrified feelings. <br> <br>Quickly,&nbsp;Not-the-body&nbsp;disappears, replaced by&nbsp;All-about-the-body.<br> <br>Because the feeling is too intense to be ignored. It\u2019s awful, so there's really no choice. <br> <br>So naturally you pay lots attention to it- describing, figuring out its meaning, analyzing, theorizing, connecting dots.<br> <br>Ignoring is not even considered, what with everyone and everything telling you to feel, and sit with, and be with, and embody. <br> <br>Which is ironic, since in the&nbsp;Got it!&nbsp;moments, you\u2019d just experienced the exact opposite of embodiment.<br> <br>And now here you are, sitting with those nasty feelings in the not-so-secret hope of tricking them into going away forever. (Shhh, don\u2019t say that part out loud.)<br> <br>Meanwhile, notice the timing of this terrible darkness.<br> <br>It shows up just as you see that you\u2019re not what you thought. <br> <br>Just as it\u2019s seen that the body is irrelevant to what you are, focus pulls you right back to that body. <br><br>Right back to the feels-terrible self.<br><br>While it tries to figure out why it can\u2019t hold onto enlightenment. <br> <br>Something is crying and curled up in a non-moving ball and pouting very hard about not being the star of the show anymore. <br> <br>Aa attention routes back to wondering what\u2019s wrong with that self, and thinking death would be better.<br> <br>Which is kind of funny, actually. I mean, here\u2019s thought saying you would be better off dead than be an illusion. <br> <br>As in, death is ok, but not-existing isn\u2019t.<br> <br>Alrighty then.<br> <br>Meanwhile, you\u2019re hoping to get back to that enlightened state. But a no-body experience can't happen when you\u2019re all about the body and its feelings. <br> <br>The body is required equipment to maintain, not dissipate, the sense of self.<br> <br>Focus on how body feels keeps one from noticing self\u2019s lack of reality.<br> <br>Feelings are the go-to resort of a mind threatened by&nbsp;its own nothingness.<br> <br>Fine.
