What am I?<br><br>Humans want to know.<br><br>We\u2019re not just mildly curious.<br><br>No. We are obsessed.<br><br>We want definitions, labels, understanding.<br><br>We turn to any source that discusses the subject. As long as they\u2019re talking about Who I Am, we listen earnestly and take notes.<br><br>There's astrology to tell us What We Are. Myers Briggs, IQ tests, Human Design, Tarot cards.<br><br>There are inquiries. Meditations. Lennnnnnnggtttthhhy facebook and satsang discourses. Books, podcasts, Elephant Journal articles. And don\u2019t forget the memes and inspirational sayings.<br><br>We let the apparent internal voice tell us Who We Are. That's always fun: \u201cYou\u2019re a loser. You\u2019re full of yourself. You\u2019re bad. A fraud. Unkind. Unlovable.\u201d<br><br>Yes, of course that hurts, but don\u2019t stop.<br><br>We even take on other people\u2019s opinions about Who We Are, too. Teacher: \u201cBilly is an overly shy boy who isn\u2019t living up to his potential.\u201d &nbsp;Okay! Billy now not only knows Who He Is, he has fodder for talking about it endlessly in years of therapy. Yay!<br><br>So many options for finding out Who I Am! &nbsp;<br><br>We might almost come to think it matters.<br><br>The thing is, regardless what tools we use, and no matter how much we act as if Who I Am is fixed, definable, and permanent\u2026<br><br>The bottom line is we don\u2019t dare take our eyes off the self for even an instant.<br><br>Because the only thing that holds I AM in place is attention.<br><br>Look away for even a moment and Poof!<br><br>Hello The Void, Ego Death, The Abyss, The Quickening, or whatever.<br><br>Gone.<br><br>Or at least, unfindable.<br><br>Not that it\u2019s actually ever been findable.<br><br>I mean, show me this \u2018you.\u2019<br><br>First there are points towards the body, as if that torso, collar bones or head is What We Are. As if we\u2019re skin, or the space in front of it.<br><br>Then comes, \u201cWell it\u2019s the brain, or heart,\u201d as if, if we removed those organs and put them on a plate, that would be us sitting there in all our findable glory on the table.<br><br>Till finally we land on, \u201cWell I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s just a<em>&nbsp;sense&nbsp;<\/em>of Me\u201d.<br><br>Like that\u2019s what we are- a \u201csense.\u201d<br><br>If so, it might be helpful to start by defining that \u2018sense\u2019 first, since who knows what <em>that&nbsp;<\/em>is.<br><br>And we might also define what knows it\u2019s there, since senses tend not to know much about such things.<br><br>So perhaps it\u2019s becoming clearer that all this What Am I-obsession is simply an opportunity to define and reify and solidify a vague, airy concept.<br><br>The self story needs an anchor to hold it. Stewing about Who Am I is such an anchor.<br><br>Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with devoting our lives to defining something that isn\u2019t there.<br><br>It\u2019s just that, if we\u2019re seeking to see through the self, as so many lovely Mind-Tickler readers strive to do, how can that possibly happen,<br><br>If we\u2019re attempting to pin down a wispy nothing by pretending we can study or question it into existence?<br><br>So just to try something different, maybe we could tear ourselves away from the mirror, and, rather than ask, \u201cWho am I?\u201d we could play a bit with asking, \u201cWhere?\u201d<br><br>We might find, as we briefly did above, that there\u2019s no provable location to be found.<br><br>We might even find that we\u2019re the question itself, and the thought, and the feeling, and the sensation, and the color, and the sound, and every experience itself.<br><br>And that there\u2019s no<em>&nbsp;I&nbsp;<\/em>at all, doing this experiencing.<br><br>So it could be there's no need to figure out who we are.<br><br>Since we\u2019re all of it.<br><br>That's a whole lot bigger than any little identified self concept.<br><br>And might even be enough to make the self happy.<br><br>I mean, probably not.<br><br>But it\u2019s at least possible that being everything makes up for the self\u2019s disappointment about being nothing.<br><br>And might be more than fair compensation for<br><br>I Am Not.<br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled<\/a> every week.<br><br><em>\"My child, you can talk about holy books all you like.
