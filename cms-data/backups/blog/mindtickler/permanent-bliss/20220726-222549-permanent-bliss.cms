Yes please.","words":1170,"content":"<em>\u201cHere\u2019s a simple test.<br>If it\u2019s soothing or comforting,&nbsp;if it\u2019s about peace, love, tranquility, silence or bliss; if it\u2019s about a brighter future; if it makes you feel good about yourself,&nbsp;boosts your self-esteem, tells you you\u2019re okay, tells you everything\u2019s just fine the way it is; if it offers to improve&nbsp;or elevate you;&nbsp;if it raises or alters consciousness; if it combats stress or deepens relaxation, or if it\u2019s therapeutic or healing, or if it promises happiness or relief from unhappiness, if it\u2019s about any of these things, then it\u2019s not about waking up. Then it\u2019s about living in the dreamstate, not smashing out of it.\u201d<br>--Jed Mckenna<br><br>----------<br><br>\"There is a sensation, and you say that you are depressed or unhappy or blissful, jealous, greedy, envious. This labelling brings into existence the one who is translating this sensation.\"<br>--UG Krishnamurti<br><\/em><br><br>The man asks me about permanent bliss.<br><br>As in, he wants it.<br><br>Really who can blame him- it\u2019s got to be better than the anxiety and depression he\u2019s got now.<br><br>He\u2019s heard from numerous sources this is an attainable goal.<br><br><em>\u201cYou can be totally different. You can have an excitement that never swings over to depression. It is the true excitement of finding yourself. Nothing is more exciting than to watch a fear fade from the mind forever. Nothing is more delightful than to possess self-command in a world of chaos. There is no greater inspiration than to know that you have found the true path at last.\"<br>\u2014Vernon Howard<\/em><br><br><em>\"Do you want to know my secret? I don't mind what happens.\" --J. Krishnamurti<\/em><br><br>Oh yeah, sounds good.<br><br>And it has to be real or there wouldn\u2019t be so many sages promising it.<br><br>So thanks Vernon and Krishnamurti and all those Rinpoches, Sri Sris, Maharshis, and others, for confusing the heck out of large numbers of people.<br><br>While claiming one thing but living another.<br><br>Because apparently no one has actually lived the permanent-bliss-filled life.<br><br>Even&nbsp;Krishnamurti, despite that famous quote above, did mind what happens, yelling at students for \u201cnot getting it\u201d, or encouraging others' celibacy while cheating with his dear friend\u2019s wife for years and then framing said friend for Krishnamurti\u2019s own business problems.<br><br>Ok then, Ramana, Nisargadatta, Mooji, Watts? Nope, nope, nope, and nope.<br><br>Just humans, reacting and experiencing non-bliss occasionally.<br><br><em>\u201cIf we could only see how the \u2018awakened ones\u2019 behave behind the scenes, it might shatter many of our spiritual illusions.\u201d \u2013Jeff Foster<\/em><br><br>Oh dear. So they\u2019re all liars?<br><br>Well, many clearly state that the dream of perpetual bliss does not change one\u2019s actual life. But mostly folks ignore that or simply don\u2019t believe them.<br><br><em>\u201cPeople expect some miracle to happen,<br>something to drop from Heaven in a flash.<br>It's nothing of the sort.<br>Only the notion that you're the body,<br>that you're this or that, will go, &amp;&nbsp;you remain as you are.&nbsp;\u201c<br>--Ramana Maharshi<\/em><br><br>They say it flat out.<br><br>So maybe we just misunderstand.<br><br>Because most seekers think the self, the ego, the person we think of as ourselves, is what attains the bliss. Enlightenment becomes something outside, something other than us, something we<em> get.<\/em><br><br>And we think we\u2019re going to be ourselves, the one who gets it.<br><br><em>\"You want to remain as you are, but at the same time, you want to know the Reality. You want to remain in the illusory world and know the Reality. Impossible! Ultimate Reality will not emerge until all body-knowledge has been dissolved.\" --Ramana<br><\/em><br>To not-mind what happens might perhaps be lovely, but we still want it to be&nbsp;Me&nbsp;that does the not-minding.<br><br>Which is not possible.<br><br><em>\u201cWhen will suffering cease? Not until individuality is lost.\u201d --Ramana<br><\/em><br>Wait, individuality gets lost?<br><br>Uh oh.<br><br><em>\u201cEverybody's searching for something.<br>Nobody's searching for nothing.\u201d --Michael Markham<\/em><br><br>Because we are the bliss, and we are all the other feelings too, and we are every thought and sound and color.<br><br>Which means we are fleeting, ephemeral, and not located anywhere.<br><br>So there is no&nbsp;<em>Me.<\/em><br><br>No&nbsp;Me&nbsp;to claim attainment of bliss, enlightenment or anything else. No&nbsp;Me&nbsp;to prefer one state over another.<br><br>We are all of it. Including bliss, including reaction, including naughty unsage-like behavior.<br><br><em>\u201cThere is no self apart from the perceiving. Perceiving is all there is.\u201d<br>--Adyashanti<br><\/em><br>On the plus side, we get to be it all.<br><br>All experiences, experiencing.<br><br>Which is why to chase perpetual bliss is to aim small.<br><br>Meanwhile, paradoxically, the falling away of the sense of self might sometimes come with a peace, a love, an equanimity.<br><br>And also the sense of self, the person and personality, remains in this life and world. As a person we talk with the spouse, hug the kids, work the job.<br><br>We continue to be recognizable as ourselves.<br><br>And soon enough that self gets annoyed with the neighbor or the government or traffic or the cable company. Soon enough, that self gets afraid or ashamed or guilty.<br><br>The self continues to experience every emotion, continues to react to difficult circumstances.<br><br>Which is no problem when we are all of that too.<br><br>Still, we can count on it- the self is what minds what happens.<br><br>So if we really want to not-mind something, we could play with not-minding that we do mind what happens.<br><br><em>\u201cHow can the illusory separate self practice something in order to reveal that it is illusory?...The life story that has apparently happened is uniquely and exactly appropriate for each awakening. All is just as it should be, right now. Not because it is a potential for something better, but simply because all that is, is divine expression.\u201d -- Tony Parsons<br><\/em><br>Because being everything is as not-small as is possible to be.<br><br>And who knows? It could turn out that<br><br>being all-encompassing divinity<br><br>might just be<br><br>pretty dang blissful.<br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br>Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/a>","extra":"","extra2":""}
