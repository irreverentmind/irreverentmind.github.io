Even when it feels good or we think it\u2019s necessary, like for example when we\u2019re talking to the cable company or hollering at some deserving elected official, there\u2019s still often an uneasy background guilt for having lost our temper.<br><br>Anger is generally accepted to indicate lack of control, flawed character, and lack of personal evolution.<br><br>Which is why people have been trying to gain the upper hand over anger since we lived in caves. &nbsp;We\u2019ve tried to understand it, find the cause, meditate, medicate, allow and eliminate it.<br><br>\u2019Course we\u2019re the same silly humans that think we can control circumstances and that if we just play things right, bad situations won\u2019t ever happen and all will be well. And naturally any resulting happiness will be all down to our good moves and choices.<br><br>Oh the power! Yay us!<br><br>And then existence giggles and says, \u201cAw honey, have some Listeria with that kale, a little nail for that tire, a layoff, a hole in that wallet pocket.\u201d<br><br>Existence is very clear who the real boss is.<br><br>It ain\u2019t us.<br><br>Which of course pisses us off.<br><br>So much for having control over anger.<br><br>What does become very clear if we\u2019re paying attention (which is almost never), is that all anger, all irritation, is a result of being forced to see that we\u2019re powerless.<br><br>Any circumstance or person, every circumstance or person, that causes us to see our powerlessness is going to make us angry.<br><br>We think, \u201cI am the boss of my life. I\u2019ll get up out of this chair without smashing my knee, having a heart attack, stubbing my toe. I\u2019ll drive in my own lane, say no to the extra serving of food, get the flu shot, go to bed early, be nice to my boss. &nbsp;All will be well. I will be master of my world.\u201d<br><br>And then some fool swerves into our lane, we lie awake for hours, get sick anyway. Dinner reservations vanish, the kids ignore us, the wrong political candidate wins, the parking attendant scratches the car, the dog barks, bites or pees or maybe all three at once, family treats us like idiots, spouses cheat, and\u2026 etc etc etc.<br><br>We are powerless all the time.<br><br>Which means there\u2019s no lack of occasions to get a good irritation on.<br><br>Of course generally we go on happily pretending we\u2019re in charge anyway. That pretense only carries us so far though, because life continually puts our impotence right in our faces regularly. It can\u2019t be pretended away.<br><br>We hate that. It makes us mad.<br><br>So the question becomes, what would the same irking situations in our lives be like if it was possible to see\u2026 \u201cOh, this is one of those situations where I\u2019m forced to see my powerlessness?\u201d<br><br>We might notice that as soon as we acknowledge our lack of control, those very same situations became far less infuriating.<br><br>That\u2019s because resisting the truth of our lack of power actually makes us angrier, and acknowledging it is calming.<br><br>This is different from suggesting, \u201cAccept the situation,\u201d although life might well be easier if that were more possible. But acceptance is not always easy, and frankly in some situations we don\u2019t even want to try.<br><br>Instead we could simply notice that we are powerless in those situations, that life is exerting its will not ours, and then sit back and watch what happens.<br><br>Things might shift; anger might relax. Even with the cable company. Just by noticing our lack of authority and the fear of that lack.<br><br>Besides, when we\u2019re not the boss, then life is running the show, which means we don\u2019t have to. Whatever happens is no longer our fault. Then there\u2019s no need for self punishment when things don\u2019t go the way it seems they should.<br><br>When the smoothness of existence no longer depends on little ol\u2019 us, we become far less important.<br><br>That can be a huge relief.<br><br>And sure, people can still try to have control. But when it\u2019s seen how much frustration, failure, shame and guilt comes along with that attempt, well who would want that?<br><br>So\u2026 powerless? Yes please. Lack of control or significance? Ahh.<br><br>We can let existence do its thing, go for the ride, enjoy the vacation.<br><br>Maybe even pet that big ol\u2019 kitty instead of poking it.<br><br>","extra":""}
