Aka symbols. &nbsp;Aka meaning.<br><br>No other species draws pictures on cave walls.<br><br>Words are symbols. They describe. They create meaning.<br><br>(Or seem to, anyway.)<br><br>They\u2019re not a thing in themselves and not the thing being described.<br><br>Words, language, symbols have created our sense of reality.<br><br>But a sense of reality is not reality itself.<br><br>That\u2019s just more seems like.<br><br>Seems like reality.<br><br>Living in a symbolic, pretend-it\u2019s-real, seems-like world has made us nuts.<br><br>So it never occurs to most of us that maybe it doesn\u2019t matter what it feels like.<br><br>It never occurs to most of us that constantly describing what things feel or seem like, obscures what is.<br><br>And what is what is? &nbsp;What real thing are we left with without words?<br><br>Well, completely take away language and we find\u2026<br><br>Experience with no describers.<br><br>Which as it turns out\u2026<br><br>Is whole lotta nothing.<br><br>You can test this for yourself.<br><br>For just a moment, try to experience without describing what you\u2019re experiencing or whether it feels like a good thing or whether you like it or what it means.<br><br>Try to experience yourself without any words at all.<br><br>Maybe you\u2019ll notice how diffuse and decentralized experience instantly becomes.<br><br>No words = no thoughts = no reality.<br><br>So ok Judy, well, no thanks. Right?<br><br>Yeah, we prefer descriptions, thank you very much.<br><br>We prefer the fakery of seems like to nothingness.<br><br>Which is fine.<br><br>But when we\u2019re hurting or scared, as so many are these days, it could just be\u2026<br><br>that things aren\u2019t actually as dark or as painful as they seem.<br><br>Because words keep suffering in place.<br><br>That seems like something that might be worth experiencing.<br><br>Wouldn\u2019t it seem so?<br><br>","extra":""}
