Hopefully that won\u2019t be the case this time, but what follows may not be popular. So, if reading this makes you want to storm off angry, well, I get it, and it\u2019s been fun hanging with you for a while anyway.<br><br>Pretty much everyone has accepted the idea that past traumas are stored somewhere in us, waiting in an unseen dark place for opportunity to spring out and make us suffer.<br><br>We\u2019re told that the past is embodied, even encoded into our cells.<br><br>While waiting to somehow be \u201cresolved,\u201d before allowing us to move on to a contented life, this painful past rules and controls our lives.<br><br>Wow, that makes this \u201cpast\u201d stuff some powerful voodoo, no?<br><br>Though if we actually looked with new eyes at that belief-bug swimming in the Kool-Aid, we might discover that it\u2019s not only not there, but also really makes no sense.<br><br>First, because there\u2019s tons of research that shows that what we call memories are actually just a few tiny, vague, split-second current-moment mental images, strung together by thought and concocted into a cohesive narrative. (No need to believe me. There's always Mr. Google.)<br><br>Turns out, no matter how real it feels, or how certain we are that we remember accurately, or how many people verify our tale\u2026<br><br>no one remembers the actual past.<br><br>The science is very clear.<br><br>Memories are completely made up.<br><br>But even if this was not the case, and even if what we think happened really did happen,<br><br>then logically, the wonderful stuff that happened is also stored in the DNA, and also rules our present.<br><br>Which means it's not only our miseries that are formative.<br><br>Meanwhile we devote all our energy and attention to trying to fix traumas that don\u2019t actually have the powers we attribute to them.<br><br>And it\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t given trauma work and therapy and sitting with feelings a really good long try. Yet here we are anyway, still thinking we're ruled by memories and pain and carrying them around forever.<br><br>Not to mention all that stewing, dissecting, validating and repeatedly summoning up the past- how exactly is that supposed to make things better?<br><br>And if it actually did improve things, there wouldn\u2019t be any folks left who are still dealing with trauma.<br><br>Everyone would have therapized it all away.<br><br>So those approaches aren\u2019t working. Under guise of \u201chealing,\u201d repeatedly rehashing and re-feeling, over and over and over, this focus is actually re-opening scabs and holding pain in place.<br><br>Which I\u2019m pretty sure is the opposite of what we want.<br><br>So maybe we could be open to something different. If only because the pain-is-in-there-forever idea is pretty darn miserable.<br><br>What if it was possible to say, \u201cOK, yes, this bad thing happened. And now it\u2019s over. Now what? Moving on. Next brand new experience coming right up.\u201d<br><br>Well that would be different, wouldn\u2019t it?<br><br>And if, right about here, the mind screams outrage for this simple, \u201cNow what?\u201d question, we might consider why it\u2019s so eager to hold on to a story that brings so much pain.<br><br>Why is it so completely uninterested in not hurting?<br><br>This may even be where objections about \u201cbypassing\u201d come up.<br><br>But bypassing can only be a problem if one buys into the Pain-Is-Lying-In-Wait story. &nbsp;Without that, it\u2019s not \u201cbypassing,\u201d it\u2019s just \u201cfeeling better.\u201d<br><br>Which I'm pretty sure would be ok with us.<br><br>So maybe all this time, we've been freer of the past than we thought.<br><br>We might finally be allowed to shift focus, feel better, and move on to present-focused, rather than past-focused, life and experiences.<br><br>And we might finally be allowed to leave past trauma in the stuffy stagnant land of, \u201cMaybe or maybe not, it's long ago either way.\u201d<br><br>Which might be startling to a mind that likes to hoard and rehash its troubles and suffering.<br><br>But can still be amazingly free when we open the windows and let the breeze blow through...<br><br>Experiencing, alive,<br><br>and completely new<br><br>in every second.<br><br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Click here to get your Mind-Tickled via email every week.<\/strong><\/em><\/a><em><strong><br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&t=6s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to watch Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pum<\/a>p<\/strong><\/em><br><br>--------<br><br><em>\u201cWe think that the world is limited and explained by its past.
