I need a touchstone when I am off kilter. I surround myself with trustworthy individuals who help reorient me. What do you think of that?\u201d<br><br>Well. Since he asked...<br><br>I think someone thinks certain individuals know more truth than he, and that they can put him right (per their version, of course).<br><br>I think someone thinks certain others are better oriented (whatever that is) and don\u2019t have off-kilter thoughts.<br><br>Also, I think someone thinks I am a trustworthy individual.<br><br>Oh dear. Should I tell him, or just leave him to his little illusions?<br><br>Either way, his question already contains its answer.<br><br>Since no human can ever know anything outside whatever our physical hardware (eyes, ears, skin etc) and conditioning is capable of perceiving.<br><br>These are sieves which create a highly unique, very individualized sense of existence.<br><br>Which gives consciousness a one-of-a kind, infinitely varied experience.<br><br>No human is exempt from this.<br><br>Including gurus, teachers and sages. They have filters, biases and conditioning too.<br><br>They have points of view, inclinations and mind-sets.<br><br>Theirs.<br><br>Their opinions are the exact same biased, filter-based, fluffy nothings as ours.<br><br>Which is why there are no \"trustworthy individuals\" who are clearer or less off-kilter than anyone else.<br><br>So yes, perception is reality.<br><br>Though it\u2019s strictly our perception, our reality. &nbsp;<br><br>Not real reality.<br><br>It\u2019s a very specifically individual, one-off reality.<br><br>Which some might find distressing.<br><br>Because no human will ever actually know what reality is.<br><br>Or even IF it is.<br><br>After all, is it truly reality if it varies from individual to individual?<br><br>I mean, anyone who has ever taken a life drawing class has seen that the view and resulting drawings completely vary depending on where in the room the artist's easel stands.<br><br>Same model, same pose. Yet as many different drawings as there are easels.<br><br>Which artist is right? Which easel position provides more truth than the other easels? Which artist sees reality?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>No one has The Answer.<br><br>Reality is a concept, and an unprovable one at that.<br><br>Which might be good news.<br><br>Because it means our own perspectives are just as true and rich and full of wow! as any guru\u2019s.<br><br>So maybe we can let up on trying to standardize this vast, infinite variety into some notion of \"reality.\"<br><br>Maybe we can enjoy the placement of our own easel,<br><br>And enjoy both the enormity... and the smallness... of our individual viewpoints.<br><br>Because we are the only one,<br><br>Literally the only one,<br><br>Who can be our particular iteration<br><br>Of consciousness.<br><br>And that is one helluva work<br><br>Of art.<br><br><br>Click here to get your <a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mind-Tickled <\/a>every week.<br>","extra":""}
