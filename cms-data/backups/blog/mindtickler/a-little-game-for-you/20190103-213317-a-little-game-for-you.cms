Or maybe we\u2019re exhausted from just trying to survive the season without calling 911.<br><br>Either way, for this New Year\u2019s Day, instead of the typical Mind-Tickling, I thought maybe it would be fun to try something different.<br><br>Ready? &nbsp;Let\u2019s play a game.<br><br>Step 1: Start by noticing and stating the \u201cbuts\u201d in your life. For example, these are things people have said to me recently:<br><br>\u2022 I love my husband but I\u2019m not interested in having sex with him.<br>\u2022 I\u2019ve gotten through this month but I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to pay my bills next month.<br>\u2022 I\u2019m surviving, but I\u2019m depressed all the time.<br>\u2022 My family\u2019s not too bad right now, but they drive me totally nuts.<br>\u2022 My mother is still holding on but it\u2019s not looking good.<br>\u2022 I\u2019m okay now but that childhood trauma still affects me.<br>\u2022 I\u2019ve had an awakening but it didn\u2019t last and I want it back.<br>\u2022 I\u2019m not anxious right now but usually it\u2019s always here.<br>\u2022 I love cake but it makes me fat.<br><br>Make a little list of your own personal \u201cButs.\u201d<br><br>You know you\u2019ve got them; everyone does. Because the mind just loves those suckers.<br><br>As you look at your list, you might begin to notice that the first half of these sentences- the words before the But- are often statements of Okayness. \u201cI\u2019m surviving\u201d, \u201cI love my husband,\u201d etc.<br><br>And then with the word But, that okayness is stolen right out from under you.<br><br>Instantly. All in one sentence.<br><br>The part after the But is <em>not<\/em>-okayness.<br><br>Almost as if thought has some kind of quota for okayness. Like it <em>prefers<\/em> the pain and is eager to get back to it.<br><br>It lets us have not-pain for about 2 whole seconds.<br><br>And then mind says, \u201cYeah yeah, okay, enough of <em>that<\/em>,\u201d and quickly uses \u201cBut\u201d to bring us back to not-okay, and back to hurting.<br><br>And then the sentence ends, and it just... <em>leaves us there.<\/em><br><br>Well, booo. That kind of sucks doesn\u2019t it?<br><br>So, step 2 of our game:<br>Switch the before-the-But and the after-the-But words.<br><br>Examples:<br>\u2022 I\u2019m not interested in having sex with him but I love my husband.<br>\u2022 I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to pay my bills next month but I\u2019ve gotten through this month.<br>\u2022 It didn\u2019t last and I want it back but I\u2019ve had an awakening.<br>\u2022 It\u2019s not looking good but my mother is still holding on.<br><br>Notice a difference?<br><br>Same words, just switched in order, and suddenly the same circumstances are less fraught.<br><br>It's calmer, gentler.<br><br>There\u2019s even easier access to gratitude.<br><br>That\u2019s because words are a description of experience, not actual experience itself. And thoughts are words (or images).<br><br>They're symbols, not the real thing.<br><br>So without having to change any actual circumstance (because really, good luck with that), it\u2019s still possible to shift our experience of any given circumstance\u2026.<br><br>Just by playing with descriptions of it.<br><br>Which means that by trying this easy little word game, we might actually find ourselves...<br><br>Hurting less.<br><br>Without having to do a thing to actual situations.<br><br>Wouldn't it be something to end sentences with peace instead of pain once in a while?<br><br>Not because Buts are bad, and not because But\u2019s usual focus on pain is bad, and not even because pain is bad.<br><br>Just simply because you can. And just simply because it may not be necessary for words to leave us with pain<em>&nbsp;all&nbsp;<\/em>the time.<br><br>Once in a while, like maybe at holiday time, maybe we can be allowed to enjoy a different description of this life we\u2019re living.<br><br>Just for a different experience.<br><br>After all, \"enjoying\" is what holidays are supposed to be about, right?<br><br>So maybe you\u2019ll go for it.<br><br>Or not.<br><br>Either way, I wish for you more ease, more lightness, a satisfying and contentment-filled new year\u2026<br><br>And of course, happy Butting.<br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\">Click to get in on the Mind-Tickler every week<\/a><br><br>","extra":""}
