We want to feel better. We want the thought storms to stop. We want to live right, do good, be good, and have the right life, whatever that might mean to us.<br><br>Goodness knows there is plenty of advice floating around debating whether it's possible to get what we want, if it's right to want that at all, and what to do to make it happen.<br><br>So many methods and teachers! &nbsp;We're rich in how-to's.<br><br>Inquiries, contemplations, meditations, ayahuasca, sitting with thoughts and feelings, allowing thoughts and feelings to be, practicing letting go and surrendering attachment...<br><br>Whew.<br><br>But... what if all that how-to-ing doesn\u2019t get actually us what we want and never will?<br><br>What if all that focus has led us astray?<br><br>Because what if the most basic assumption in all of that methodology is misdirected?<br><br>What if we are not The One Who Has A Thought or Feeling?<br><br>What if we are not The Noticer of the feelings and thoughts either?<br><br>What if what we are is feeling itself, thoughts themselves, colors, shapes, images, sensations themselves?<br><br>What if what we are is literally experience itself?<br><br>...This feeling and then this thought and then this one and then this one; each feeling \/ thought replaced by the next, just constantly changing experience...<br><br>If experience is what we are, then all the ideas about who or what we are, are just more thoughts.<br><br>And what if we are those too.<br><br>Then it doesn't much matter what thoughts are about or it they're true, does it? &nbsp;We're all of them anyway.<br><br>So then, if we're thinking itself- not the thinker, not the Witnesser of the thinker- then maybe there\u2019s nothing to do.<br><br>Maybe there's nothing to fix, no one to study methods and follow teachers, no one to improve, no one to inquire and no one to inquire about.<br><br>Because if we are experience rather than the thing that does the experiencing or the thing that witnesses, then we are not a THING.<br><br>We\u2019re non-existent. &nbsp;We're changing every second. We\u2019re everything. We\u2019re nothing.<br><br>Which means we- the person\/personality named Judy or Ralph or Alice or Joe- we\u2019re no-thing.<br><br>Which also means we're not at fault, not responsible, not the doer, and flat-out not there to improve or fix at all.<br><br>We're off the hook.<br><br>See how that feels.<br><br>If it feels peaceful, relieving, even joyful, then why not go with it for a moment.<br><br>Maybe rest for just a moment with the peace of possibility that what we are is experience and nothing more.<br><br>Maybe figure things out and let thought take over and make itself and us a SomeThing That Needs To Be Improved, later.<br><br>For now, we might just BE, and enjoy getting what we want.<br><br>By doing nothing.<br>","extra":""}
