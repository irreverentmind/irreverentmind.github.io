We want things to make sense.<br><br>Enter The Witness, Being Aware of Awareness, Going Inward, Big Self, Little Self, The Path, The Gate. Enter satsangs and gurus and unending questions and requests for explanations from said gurus.<br><br>Understanding will be ours. Whoo hooo!<br><br>Although\u2026 what exactly does this understanding? What transcends the self\u2019s usual focus on me-me-me in order to comprehend, see through, and be aware of\u2026<br><br>Itself?<br><br>I mean, it\u2019s certainly not the self. That would make understanding dependent on a very unreliable source.<br><br>Especially since trying to transcend, trying get outside of the mind in order to comprehend the mind, would thus be using that very same mind to do it.<br><br>Which is a brilliantly looping rigged system.<br><br>After all, even the word \u201crealized\u201d contains the word \u201creal.\u201d &nbsp;The word makes real, a being, a subject, which realizes and is aware of awareness.<br><br>Which makes awareness of awareness a subjective experience. A subject, The Me, is aware of itself and therefore separate from the thing (Me) it is aware of.<br><br>So we say we want comprehension of no-self and no separation and not-two, and we want to get outside ourselves to see our selves, and yet still\u2026<br><br>Getting-Outside starts from the Right-Here.<br><br>Which isn\u2019t outside.<br><br>Nothing can get outside itself.<br><br>Making Awareness as we understand it, actually just more us. The Witness is just more us.<br><br>Regardless of how spacious and big it \"feels like.\"<br><br>Understanding reifies the self.<br><br>Perhaps you can see the flaw in this approach.<br><br>Luckily though, no matter what we think or feel like,<br><br>Consciousness is not in little ol\u2019 us. We are in it.<br><br>We are OF it.<br><br>Making us It, itself.<br><br>The Divine, the vast, the incomprehensible.<br><br>We are that.<br><br>Which means, while we happily explain what awareness is and how it works and how we can \u201caccess\u201d it,<br><br>We are everything, every experience. Already.<br><br>Look at us, Being it.<br><br>We are joy and beauty and anger and tears and laughter and color and music and triggers and pain and addictions.<br><br>Because what is awareness, consciousness, the Divine, if not Everything?<br><br>Whether understood by humans or not.<br><br>And leaving no one, no Me, no locatable point of view, to understand.<br><br>So it may be a relief to know that we never will. We\u2019ll never comprehend.<br><br>Whether we're certain we do or not.<br><br>And despite all those fist-shaking assurances on social media.<br><br>Human understanding is not possible.<br><br>Though sure, we can keep trying. Why not?<br><br>After all, understanding is IN it too.
