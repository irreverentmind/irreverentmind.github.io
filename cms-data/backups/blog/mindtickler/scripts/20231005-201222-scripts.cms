Just like everyone else.\u201d<br>--Margaret Mead<br><br>----------<br><br>\"There are no new thoughts, they're all recycled.\"<br>--Byron Katie<\/em><br><br><br>When you hear from as many folks as I have over the years, listening to people recite their feelings, issues, problems and wishes, you begin to notice something.<br><br>You begin to see that while of course, everyone\u2019s day to day circumstances are totally unique and one of a kind, the way everyone experiences and talks about problems is shockingly all the same.<br><br>You begin to see the mind-patterns that come with being a person.<br><br>All people talk about problems using the exact same words. Sometimes word for word.<br><br>Like a song with memorized lyrics.<br><br>Around the world, regardless of age and situation, thought has a literal script, which it recites throughout lifetimes, and generations.<br><br>Lives are being lived on script.<br><br>While no one person says&nbsp;all&nbsp;of the available script, everyone, without exception, says&nbsp;some&nbsp;of it.<br><br>Like a menu- pick your special:<br><br>This is the problem:<br>Somethin\u00adg\u2019s not right. Something\u2019s not OK.<br><br>This is how it feels:<br>A contraction, a tension, a heaviness, an emptiness, a sense.<br><br>This is what's needed:<br>Peace, others\u2019 love, safety, motivation, energy, control, sleep, money, success, health, loved ones to stay forever, equanimity, change, others\u2019 right behavior, better feelings.<br><br>This is what it means:<br>Bad person, loser, unlovable, lazy, weak, broken, not social enough, not confidant enough, not kind enough, not enlightened enough, just plain not enough, wasted life.<br><br>This is the cause (the why):<br>Trauma, the past, wasted potential, wrong choices, wrong actions, others.<br><br>The script is common, predictable, unoriginal, repetitive, and the same everywhere.<br><br>Additionally on this menu is the obligatory idea that these thoughts are \u201cyours.\u201d<br><br>Supposedly they happen specifically to you, in your own head.<br><br>Conveniently creating that unique, difficult, and singular- you.<br><br>Proving your separateness, proving your distinction from everything and everyone else.<br><br>The thought script enables the sense of \u201cMe.\u201d<br><br>When actually, it\u2019s community property.<br><br>The mind is a collective.<br><br>Everyone dips from the same pool.<br><br>Which means not one of those thoughts belongs to you.<br><br>Not one is actually about you at all.<br><br>Mind is just singing its song. Reciting its words.<br><br>Thought constructs a \u201creality\u201d using this small, unoriginal handful of words.<br><br>All while insisting how unique we are.<br><br>Now, you could be thrilled to learn that you\u2019re not alone, not special, and that these thoughts aren\u2019t yours or particular to you.<br><br>But more likely, you are disbelieving, feeling misunderstood, perhaps annoyed, and mentally arguing for your special personal pain and messed-upness.<br><br>\u201cNo way!\u201d you may be saying. \u201cMy situation is different, My situation is worse. Other people don\u2019t suffer like this. Other people aren\u2019t this messed up. It\u2019s me. I\u2019m different.\u201d<br><br>Surprise! All that special-you stuff is part of the script too.<br><br>Luckily though, whether you believe it or not, this community pool is actually good news.<br><br>Because if thoughts are not yours and not about you,<br><br>even though they appear to be, even if they insist so,<br><br>Then&nbsp;what you are&nbsp;becomes unclear.<br><br>Harder to pin down. Perhaps even harder to hurt.<br><br>Since the person hurting becomes harder to find.<br><br>Which unpredictably<br><br>may provide relief and<br><br>a not-taking-things-seriously lightness<br><br>which just might turn out to be<br><br>a special<br><br>not on the usual menu.","extra":"","extra2":""}
