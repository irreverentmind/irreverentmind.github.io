All of them say some version of, \u201cThis pain will be with me forever. My inner work will continue for the rest of my life.\u201d<br><br>Which makes me sad.<br><br>Because decades later, these folks are still feeling pain over situations and events which are long gone.<br><br>The trauma is over.<br><br>But apparently it\u2019s never ending, and there\u2019s always some trigger, some reminder&nbsp;to hurt all over again.<br><br>Y'know, in case they forgot.<br><br>So from here, their pain starts to seem like an old friend, a pet, a reliable go-to when things get too quiet. It starts to seem like&nbsp;a thought-path for explanations, excuses, and problem-solving,<br><br>when things have the nerve to go too well in life.<br><br>(Yes, I said that. See? Angry.)<br><br>Replaying, revisiting, remembering. Sitting with feelings. Over and over and over.<br><br>The thing is, if one is forever triggered, forever feeling old pain, forever trying to figure out what happened so it doesn\u2019t happen again,<br><br>then all that trauma work isn\u2019t working, is it?<br><br>Because there\u2019s no endgame. There\u2019s no way out. It's a forever project, and there\u2019s always more work to do.<br><br>Meanwhile, if it\u2019s necessary to have a peaceful past in order to have a peaceful present, do you know who\u2019s screwed?<br><br>Everyone.<br><br>Because everyone has some trauma, everyone has a less-than-desirable past experience. No one has a life of no-pain, no intensity, no&nbsp;I-hate-this-this-is-awful-make-it-stop.<br><br>Yet everyone thinks their suffering is special, and worse than others\u2019.<br><br>The old pain becomes an identity. The self becomes identified by old hurt.<br><br>That\u2019s how you know who, and what, and&nbsp;that,&nbsp;you are.<br><br>While meanwhile, really being just exactly like everyone else.<br><br>Reliving, replaying, re-feeling.<br><br>Rehearsing.<br><br>Memorizing.<br><br>The opposite of setting free. More like setting in stone.<br><br>All while supposedly trying to be free of it.<br><br>The actuality is, you don\u2019t want your trauma&nbsp;gone. That\u2019s why you do those methods, and revere those \u201chealers,\u201d who don\u2019t actually help the pain leave.<br><br>Because the identity of hurting-you, a you formed and based on pain, is precious.<br><br>It feels like crap but at least you know what you\u2019re dealing with.<br><br>Whereas whatever peace or freedom might replace that pain and that story, is unknown, unfamiliar, uncertain.<br><br>And leaves&nbsp;you with nothing.<br><br>That\u2019s scarier than the old trauma.<br><br>So&nbsp;a whole current life gets ignored&nbsp;in favor of a mental movie.<br><br>Because that\u2019s all \"the past\" is.<br><br>It's not reality.<br><br>Maybe it was, once. But now it\u2019s just a movie.<br><br>Still, it feels so real, because it\u2019s bolstered by popular ideas such as, \u201cIt\u2019s stored in there- in the unconscious, or in the body, or in the DNA.\u201d<br><br>As if those storage ideas are anything at all more than reasons to continue holding onto and never releasing,<br><br>pain you don't even want.<br><br>So if change is truly desired, wouldn\u2019t it be interesting, or at least different, (and different is what\u2019s needed at this point if you truly don\u2019t want to hurt forever,) to notice actual present life instead of the movie.<br><br>Noticing&nbsp;all the literal, actual, non-threat that is happening&nbsp;right now.&nbsp;The literal actual present. The literal actual safety. The literal actual okness happening this very second.<br><br>Yes, the mind dismisses all that, finding it uninteresting and \u201cunhelpful.\u201d<br><br>And yes, everyone else supports that same useless reinforcing of story.<br><br>Because let\u2019s face it, they have the same mind you do. So of course everyone agrees that, once burned, you must remain screaming in pain forever.<br><br>But if that\u2019s true, then why even bother with trauma work? If it\u2019s stuck in there, then it\u2019s not coming out. No point in the busywork of trying to make it leave.<br><br>Still, it's fine to keep at your forever project anyway.<br><br>But if freedom and peace is truly what you want, it might make sense instead,<br><br>to&nbsp;notice the abundant freedom and peace<br><br>you already have.<br><br>It might make sense instead,<br><br>to notice where&nbsp;that's&nbsp;stored.<br><br>And then it might make sense instead,<br><br>to see what's left<br><br>of trauma,<br><br>and of you.<br><br><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td valign=\"top\"><table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td><table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td valign=\"top\"><em>\"The past is made of memory, the future of imagination.
