There\u2019s spiritual tourism to India, trekking to sit for a few minutes in a long-dead Wise One\u2019s cave.<br><br>As if the cave contains that Teacher\u2019s magic, which is apparently stuck in there and unable to be transmitted to some fluffier location such as, say, Poughkeepsie.<br><br>But I digress.<br><br>There\u2019s huggy, smiley selfies taken with the admired Teacher after satsang, complete with held-up autographed book, soon to become proud profile pictures.<br><br>There are even literal altars- dedicated spaces carved out in tiny living spaces- with photos of the Revered One along with crystals, prayer candles, various talismans and statues of the Buddha.<br><br>All of which seems kind of weird.<br><br>If only because a picture of Ramana or Amma or Parmahansa XYZ is not what those sages are or ever were.<br><br>Pictures and altars and books are symbols- substitutes for something else- maybe a longing for oneness. &nbsp;<br><br>Though oneness can\u2019t be experienced or recognized via symbols. Representations are a step removed from the \"real.\" That creates the appearance of two, not one.<br><br>Which every good non-dualist knows is the opposite of what is being sought.<br><br>Besides, if we're not-a-self, then these same Teachers are also not selves, also not there, also illusion.<br><br>So who or what is being worshipped, and by whom?<br><br>Not that any of this is the end of the world, or even a problem. I mean, jeez, let us adore happily away in peace. Seems harmless enough.<br><br>It\u2019s just that, when we idealize the Teacher- who is after all human just like us- we\u2019re pretty much missing the point their teachings are supposedly intended to pass along in the first place.<br><br>We're actually missing what we've been seeking all these years.<br><br>The story of the wise Other, the Not-Me, who has Something that we don\u2019t, pulls attention to the guru as the Provider of answers, connection and love, creates a sense of Them and Not-Them (aka us),<br><br>And solidifies the individual\u2019s already pervasive sense of lack, missing something, and needing improvement.<br><br>Idolization of teachers anchors the sense of self.<br><br>This is probably not what any acolyte wants or seeks.<br><br>Perhaps a bit less harmless though, is that teacher idealization causes us to miss that we already have, and already are, exactly what we\u2019re hoping to find in this Other.<br><br>Which means the sought is not in the Other.<br><br>It\u2019s not over there.<br><br>It\u2019s here. It\u2019s us.<br><br>We\u2019re the love for them and the feelings of missing something and the thoughts and the images and the selfies and the wisdom.<br><br>We\u2019re Them. We\u2019re It.<br><br>What we\u2019ve been looking for in teachers, has been here, as us, all along. &nbsp;<br><br>So we\u2019re not lacking.<br><br>What we seek is already ours.
