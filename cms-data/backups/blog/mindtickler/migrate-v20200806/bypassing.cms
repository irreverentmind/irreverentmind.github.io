We need to sit with them, validate them, turn towards them.<br><br>If we want contentment and better feelings later, we have to dive into and focus on bad feelings, not good ones, now.<br><br>Which is some kind of weird circular reasoning, considering that what we ultimately want to sit with bad feelings for, is to get those spacious good feelings. Which are already here. <em>Without<\/em> having to wait by dwelling on suffering.<br><br>But okay.<br><br>Second we all also know that in order to get shifts in the future, to feel good in the future, to be <em>entitled<\/em> to feel good in the future\u2026<br><br>We must have <em>AHA!s<\/em> and realizations and better understandings of our past, our patterns, our inner child, first.<br><br>And if we're feeling content already, we may not bother with all that investigation and inquiry, and critical discoveries about self will get prevented, downright <em>diverted,<\/em> by too much feeling good.<br><br>So it's very important to not let peace get in the way of, and bypass, paying attention to all that pain.<br><br>After all, there's no relief that can't be improved by a good dose of efforting.<br><br>Then more peace, <em>better<\/em> peace, righter peace, will be ours at last.<br><br>No?
