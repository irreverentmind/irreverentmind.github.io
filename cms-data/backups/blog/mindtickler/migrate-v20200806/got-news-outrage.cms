Politics, lies, unfairness, immorality.<br><br>There\u2019s no lack of situations to stir up strong feelings.<br><br>And while the news media has always tried to rile us up, always been about fear, drama, tears, always poked the story-craver in us....<br><br>These days, the news business\u2013 particularly cable news- is booming through the roof. You want intensity? Cable news has got yer intensity right here.<br><br>Want proof? &nbsp;<br><br><em>\u201cTrump.\u201d<\/em><br><br>See?<br><br>Love him or hate him, the man is a ratings bonanza, and we\u2019re drawn in to the circus.<br><br>Humans just love a good outrage. Require it, actually.<br><br>We get high on intensity. Not high as in, \u201cWheee!\u201d but souped up, marinated in the adrenaline and other body chemicals induced by drama.<br><br>And because we\u2019re junkies, we seek out strong feelings. On the news, on Facebook, on Twitter.

After a while, they\u2019re boring.<br><br>Too calm. Too quiet. No problem to solve. No thing to think about.<br><br>C'mon, no one can maintain a sense of self like that.<br><br>No. Turn on the news and see what Trump did today. Give us something juicy to feel.<br><br>Focus on feeling solidifies the sense of self. Intensity tricks us into feeling real, so we don\u2019t notice we\u2019re not.<br><br>Which is why there\u2019s a constant craving for excitement and strong feelings of any kind. &nbsp;<br><br>Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with this.<br><br>It\u2019s just that this focus causes us to miss a lot.<br><br>We miss the OK-ness all around us. We miss the enough-ness of it all.
