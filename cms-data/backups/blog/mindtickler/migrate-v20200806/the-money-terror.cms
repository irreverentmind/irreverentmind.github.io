Not having enough. Running out of what\u2019s here now and living out of a shopping cart under a bridge.<br><br>Of course you realize that if all the people who were afraid of being homeless actually ended up homeless, people would be stacked in chest-high piles in the streets. Which is not the case.<br><br>But never mind.<br><br>And omg where will more money come from? Clearly no one is hiring or clients won\u2019t come or the stock market won't recover.<br><br>There is absolute certainty that this is a real problem, a real danger.<br><br>Surely there\u2019s something that can be DONE to make money happen and ease this panic. Read up. Take internet courses. Make budgets and cut back.<br><br>Do everything but notice whether there is an actual problem.<br><br>Refuse to consider that maybe there\u2019s nothing you can do.<br><br>That feels too dangerous.<br><br>Nothing but doom can come of letting go of this particular problem.<br><br>Everyone knows this.<br><br>\u201cI have to solve it!\u201d<br><br>Interesting. <br><br>See how important that makes you?<br><br>How solid, how real?<br><br>How handy.<br><br>What if all that worry and panic is not really about money?<br><br>Yes, it does look like it\u2019s about money. But maybe it\u2019s not.<br><br>What if terror about money is just another way to solidify the self-story?<br><br>\u201cHi, I\u2019m me, I\u2019m (insert name here), I\u2019m worried about money.\u201d<br><br>Okay, okay, stop rolling your eyes and just play with me a moment.<br><br>You\u2019ve been fretting about trying to solve this situation for a while now, right?<br><br>Is it working?<br><br>Let's consider something different.<br><br>Maybe worrying about money is a trick, a deception, a ploy, of thought.<br><br>\u201cLook over here at this disaster! Pay no attention over there, where you\u2019re safe right now. No no, over here, over here!\u201d<br><br>Strategy.<br><br>It seems to all depend on YOU.<br><br>It feels miserable. But it does the job.<br><br>The me-story gets to survive. Unnoticed. On autopilot.<br><br>Because while the song repeats, \u201cI need money I need money what about money danger danger money I need money,\u201d like an old cassette tape on replay,<br><br>repetition locks your attention into problem, solutions, fears, and ignores\u2026<br><br>WHAT is in actual danger?<br><br>What needs to be in charge, do something, fix things, get money?<br><br>What needs money?<br><br>Point to it.<br><br>Is it that body? Elbows, heart, fingers? They don\u2019t care about money.<br><br>They don\u2019t care if they live or die either.<br><br>How about whatever it is that notices body, or that \u201csense\u2019 of Me- do they need money?<br><br>What for?<br><br>So\u2026. what exactly is in danger, needs more, needs a solution?<br><br>Could it be\u2026 nothing?<br><br>I know when you\u2019re scared to death about money that this kind of talk seems like, \u201cLook lady, don\u2019t distract me with this woo-woo crap. I have a real problem here.\u201d<br><br>But it could just be that when it\u2019s seen there is nothing here that has a problem and nothing to solve, options open up.<br><br>Without you.<br><br>Solutions show up. Solutions that don\u2019t involve you as the King Of All Answers.<br><br>Maybe you don\u2019t actually need to know how to solve things. Maybe it\u2019s not up to you. Maybe you don\u2019t need to know anything.<br><br>Maybe it will take care of itself.<br><br>Because the habit of focusing on oneself as real solid problem and solution all in one can get in the way of openness to something bigger, something not-me, something wiser and with unlimited options available.<br><br>It could be that when you notice how the thought, \u201cI am the one who has to do something\u201d creates a sense of ME,<br><br>you also begin to notice that money comes from surprising places, in surprising ways.<br><br>By itself.<br><br>It doesn\u2019t need you to run the show and figure things out.<br><br>An idea comes in the middle of the night, someone sends money out of the blue, a job appears out of nowhere, a new love turns into marriage, a relocation opportunity effortlessly arises.<br><br>When you\u2019re hyperventilating and thinking it\u2019s all up to you, you might fail to notice how answers show up on their own.<br><br>Yeah you might still be scared. Yeah you\u2019ll probably still be triggered by the sight of a bank statement. You\u2019ll probably still focus on disastrous-future thoughts.<br><br>That\u2019s what habits do. They repeat.<br><br>That may not be fun.<br><br>But it\u2019s also not the doom-filled end of the world.<br>","extra":""}
