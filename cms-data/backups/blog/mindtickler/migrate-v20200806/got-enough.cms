Emptiness alert! Incompleteness! Lack!","words":585,"content":"Oh look, a donut!<br><br>\u2018Course, donuts come with holes.<br><br>Uh oh. Emptiness alert! Incompleteness! Lack!<br><br>We all know emptiness is bad. Emptiness is deficiency. Emptiness is missing out.<br><br>We don't want no stinkin' emptiness.<br><br>Oh my. Better take action. Better get some donut-holes too.<br><br>Yep. Fill that space up to the enough-ness line.<br><br>And now, suppose we\u2019re not talking about donuts. Suppose we\u2019re talking about you.<br><br>I mean, look at you. You obviously are not enough as is. You obviously need more money or love or health, beauty, youth, safety, control, happiness, peace.<br><br>Ugh.<br><br>Void, anyone?<br><br>Maybe order up some calm, some bliss, some enlightenment while you're at it.<br><br>Although... that enlightenment stuff can be tricky, since it is supposed to come with void encouragement rather than void filler. &nbsp;Which does complicate things and make the whole subject kind of scary. I mean, encourage the void? Yikes.<br><br>Still, it's OK. Because the list of stuff you need more-of can go on and on and on. So just go for all of it. That should fill \u2018er up.<br><br>The thing is, if you did finally fill in all the holes and attain \u201cenough,\u201d what would that even look like?<br><br>Well shoot, how would any of us know?<br><br>I mean it\u2019s not like we can trust thought here. After all, when was the last time thought said, \u201cOK yeah, I have enough money now. I have enough control. I have enough enlightenment, calm, happiness. I can rest now?\u201d<br><br>That answer would probably be, \u201cNever.\u201d<br><br>Mind routinely rejects the enough it has, while searching for more enough elsewhere. &nbsp;<br><br>And since there\u2019s always something more to get, enough-ness never really shows up. Though even if it did, it wouldn't matter.<br><br>Because we're paying attention exclusively to the hole, and missing the whole.<br><br>So I wonder what would happen if we were able to play with shifting that attention.<br><br>Instead of trying to figure out what\u2019s missing and how to fix that\u2026<br><br>What if we could feel into \u201cWhatever it is that we really are\u201d (not getting sidetracked by figuring out or naming that right now)\u2026<br><br>And what if we could ask, \u201cIs What-I-really-am lacking connectedness, from itself or anything else? In fact is it lacking anything at all?\u201d<br><br>Perhaps we might be able to see that it\u2019s... Everything.<br><br>Huh.<br><br>Everything can\u2019t be disconnected. Everything can\u2019t be insufficient.<br><br>Y'know, because it\u2019s everything.<br><br>So while the individual, in its constant attempts at completeness, yearns so much to connect to the vast enough-ness\u2026<br><br>And while the personality yearns so much to have more, get more, BE more,<br><br>It turns out we\u2019re already the everything donut, not the separated and empty hole.<br><br>Here we are, pining so hard, trying so hard, to be what we already are.<br><br>Complete. Sufficient. Connected.<br><br>Not to mention yummy.<br><br>All along. Realized or not.<br><br>And that is so much more than\u2026<br><br>Enough.<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\">Click to get in on the Mind-Tickler every week<\/a>","extra":""}
