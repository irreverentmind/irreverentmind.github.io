And anxious. Some days it can feel false to smile, it\u2019s hard to function, and just getting out of bed is a challenge.<br><br>She thinks she\u2019s a loser. She thinks she\u2019s wasting her life. She thinks she should have a partner, more friends, get more done. She thinks she should stop all addictions, and get more healthy. She should help people, and have an impact on the world.<br><br>Watching, evaluating, monitoring herself.<br><br>Obviously there\u2019s some flaw in her, something wrong with her, which makes it impossible to have a good life.<br><br>So of course it\u2019s up to her to fix it.<br><br>She really should do that ASAP.<br><br>Although it\u2019s not as if she hasn\u2019t tried. She\u2019s done the meditating, the inquiries, the self-help, therapy, affirmations, retreats. &nbsp;All that going inward and sitting-with the pain, allowing it- she\u2019s done that up the wazoo.<br><br>Shouldn\u2019t she know better by now? Well, actually, she <em>does<\/em> know better. And yet, here it is anyway- this wrong life, these wrong feelings.<br><br>This should not be happening.<br><br>Sound familiar? &nbsp;What, you thought it was just you?<br><br>In my work with clients, I hear some version of these kinds of things all day, every day. In fact, such thoughts and feelings are so common, repeated so often\u2026<br><br>It\u2019s almost like there\u2019s a script or something.<br><br>A script for suffering? No, no, no, weird Mind-Tickler-writer-person, that can\u2019t be right.<br><br>Although\u2026. If any of these thoughts <em>do<\/em> sound familiar, then they can\u2019t be just one person\u2019s property, can they?<br><br>If they appear to a whole lot of other heads, then they \u201cbelong to\u201d a whole lot of people.<br><br>Like, pretty much everyone.<br><br>I mean, it could well be that the mind is simply like an old LP on repeat, happily focused on the Me Me Me, and on flaws, and failures, and not-enoughs, and too-muches. &nbsp;<br><br>Maybe it all boils down to mind happily singing its me-centered song.<br><br>Just to have something to do.<br><br>And then we go and think, \u201cOh look at this evidence that I\u2019m all messed up. This is all about meeee.\u201d<br><br>Sort of like, \u201cI feel, therefore I exist.\u201d &nbsp;<br><br>Taking it very personally. &nbsp;Even though that doesn\u2019t feel at all good.<br><br>Meanwhile, there\u2019s so much evidence that these very same thoughts and feelings have been swirling through and around billions of heads since mankind could speak words.<br><br>Which would make depression not personal, and anxiety not personal\u2026<br><br>and none of it meaning anything at all about any one individual person.<br><br>As in, nothing to do with us.<br><br>Well. That might feel better.<br><br>It certainly lets us off the hook. After all, there\u2019s simply no need to fix property that isn\u2019t ours. &nbsp;<br><br>And then, feelings like those labeled \u201cdepression\u201d or \u201canxiety\u201d could be free to come and go, blow in and blow out.<br><br>Without occupying huge chunks of our attention. Without activating the solution-finding apparatus.<br><br>Which would mean the same feelings and experiences could still happen, only with much less urgency, much less importance, much less heaviness.<br><br>They could be seen to be\u2026.<br><br>Just feelings.<br><br>Just thoughts.<br><br>Here, sometimes.<br><br>Not here, other times.<br><br>Ah.<br><br>Next.<br><br><br><em>\"The separate self by definition is seeking happiness.
