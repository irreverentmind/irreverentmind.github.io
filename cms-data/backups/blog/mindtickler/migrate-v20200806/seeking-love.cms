Where is it? Is it ever enough?","words":937,"content":"Love.<br><br>We\u2019ve been looking for it since forever.<br><br>Since infancy we\u2019ve been searching for love from parents, partners, siblings, friends, children, bosses, strangers in the street.<br><br>Seeking. Out there. From them. Towards us.<br><br>It\u2019s the absolute unquestioned \u201cOf course!\u201d religion for many of us.<br><br>\u201cC\u2019mon Judy, we gotta have love!\u201d<br><br>Musssst haavvvve loovvve.<br><br>As if we\u2019re zombies prowling for brains or something. Constantly on the hunt.<br><br>Sometimes we even think we catch some once in a while.<br><br>Yay!<br><br>Then it leaves. Or goes to someone else instead. Or changes. Or gets uninteresting. Or it wasn\u2019t the right kind of love. Or there wasn\u2019t enough of it. &nbsp;<br><br>Boo.<br><br>So here comes one of those questions we\u2019re not supposed to ask, and that causes some of you to get mad at me when I do anyway.<br><br>Do we really need others\u2019 love?<br><br>Other than that it feels good, what for?<br><br>What makes chasing love so gosh-darned important that it runs our lives?<br><br>I know we want it, I know we like it, I know it feels like we need their love.<br><br>But\u2026<br><br>Think about it; if you can, just for a moment set aside all the brain washing and mass hypnosis going on.<br><br>Is scoring other people\u2019s love necessary for life?<br><br>Nah.<br><br>If it was necessary, there wouldn\u2019t be vast numbers of people- alive people, existing people- who don\u2019t have others\u2019 love.<br><br>They don\u2019t have love; just ask them, they\u2019ll tell you!<br><br>And yet, life goes on.<br><br>So yes we certainly enjoy love. It\u2019s wonderful; I understand.<br><br>Life certainly feels more fun with it, not as fun or even downright bad without it.<br><br>But having others\u2019 love is not a requirement.<br><br>Thought says we need it.<br><br>But no.<br><br>Besides, have you noticed how it becomes all about Me when we don\u2019t get others to demonstrate love towards us?<br><br>\u201cSee? I\u2019m unlovable!\u201d<br><br>When it appears others don\u2019t love us, we think it means something...<br><br>About us.<br><br>Invariably we conclude, \u201cThis means I\u2019m unlovable \/deficient \/a loser.\u201d<br><br>Which is one reason why the need to be loved by others, hurts.<br><br>Because it seems to indicate that we are not sufficient as we are.<br><br>Without others pouring their love into our empty vessel so that we can fill up to the enough-mark...<br><br>We\u2019re lacking. We\u2019re missing something.<br><br>But this meaning-applying is just a trick of mind.<br><br>Try taking thought off its usual, \u201cWoe is lonely unloved me, I need love from him- her- them\u201d track, and see if, without someone else feeling the right things about us, we are enough right in this moment, anyway.<br><br>Aren\u2019t we?<br><br>\u2018Course we are.<br><br>\u201cLack\/not enough\u201d turns out to be just a cute little lie the mind tells.<br><br>We\u2019re actually just fine as is.<br><br>However much love we do or don\u2019t score.<br><br>So maybe we don\u2019t need to suck up other people\u2019s love like some brain-eater or desperately hungry vampire.<br><br>Because while we\u2019re trying so hard to get people to love us, turns out there are other things we don\u2019t notice, too.<br><br>Such as, if we have to try so hard to get love, can we trust what we get when we appear to succeed?<br><br>Yeah, not likely.<br><br>And, does the love felt in another person\u2019s body have anything to do with our own body?<br><br>That\u2019s their love.<br><br>How does what they feel in their chest (or whatever body part) have anything to do with us?<br><br>Except again for the meaning we assign.<br><br>So, what if it was somehow magically possible to stop searching day and night for more or better love, and just make do with what\u2019s here?<br><br>Focusing on the love we have rather than what we can get.<br><br>It could be that when we focus on the feelings in our own chest, we begin to notice how much love, of our own, we already have.<br><br>Love that we get to feel.<br><br>Towards others.<br><br>Instead of saying \u201cGimme gimme\u201d to their feelings, we get our own feelings-in-the-chest.<br><br>Regardless of what they feel.<br><br>All ours.<br><br>No one can take that from us.<br><br>In fact, it could be that what is in us might more than make up for what is or isn\u2019t in others\u2019 chests.<br><br>Which means we wouldn't have to try so hard to make people love us.<br><br>Wouldn\u2019t that be something.<br><br>That is why I hope you can enjoy the feeling in your own chest this Valentine\u2019s week.<br><br>Because it could just be that you\u2019ve got more than enough love already.<br><br>And maybe your own love makes you (gasp) more than enough, too.<br><br>Oh I love that for you.<br><br>","extra":""}
