Neon. Something big and obviously not usual.<br><br>Although, I was depressed a lot, so really how rare could the instigating thoughts have been?<br><br>No, the bringer of my depression was nothing out of the ordinary.<br><br>And I could never find the trigger.<br><br>Because it was part of my fabric.<br><br>I was repeatedly being built- constructed- on that thought. &nbsp;<br><br>The sense of the Me, the Judy, was being built on TV\u2019s pretend scripts about pretend people living pretend lives.<br><br>Unknowingly, I was gathering up fictions to prove unprovable theories about who I was as a supposedly real Person.<br><br>Fiction was being used as proof of the fiction of self.<br><br>Dependent on ordinary thoughts which came out of nowhere, bringing along with them ordinary feelings.<br><br>Feelings which, simply by their apparent existence, \"felt as if\" they anchored the sense of me solidly to heaviness.<br><br>Heaviness being a great self anchor.<br><br>Even though it's nothing, holding down nothing.<br><br>So it doesn\u2019t matter what any thought or explanation of feelings turns out to be.<br><br>It doesn\u2019t, and can\u2019t, prove fiction.<br><br>Because fiction is made up. Fiction isn't provable.<br><br>Those old ideas of \u201cwho I am,\u201d &nbsp;turned out to be just ordinary everyday thoughts, carrying lovely feelings like depression to help the wacky self come to some (bad) conclusion about itself.<br><br>To make sure I didn\u2019t forget I exist.
