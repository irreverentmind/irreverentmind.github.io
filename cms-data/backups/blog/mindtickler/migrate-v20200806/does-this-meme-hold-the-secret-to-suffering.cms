Maybe even inspiring. Certainly this meme makes a point no one could argue or disagree with. Everyone knows that\u2019s the right way to live, the right way to be.<br><br>Although, could be everyone\u2019s been drinking the Kool-Aid on this one.<br><br>Because this kind of \"You-Can-Be-Better!\" thinking is everywhere. Which means thought is comfortable with that approach. And considering how infrequently any commonly-accepted thought is true, maybe that comfort is worth a re-look.<br><br>And when we do look- ah, there it is... the clear, hidden-in-plain-sight message in any What-We-All-Should-Be meme like this one above. You... well, ok, there's no nice way... let's just face it\u2026<br><br>You aren't good enough. Not as is. You should be different.<br><br>Notice how that feels? Yeah. Bad.<br><br>There\u2019s an ideal way to be. You're not it.<br><br>Better fix that.<br><br>Hello self help, inquiry, therapy, meditation, satsangs and spiritual seeking.<br><br>Billions and billions are spent on fixing broken humans.<br><br>And yet, not only do you fail to live up to the ideal, you also never seem to get properly fixed. There's always another situation, another reaction, another face-palmed What-have-I-done.<br><br>Hello deficient, inadequate, bad person. Hello loser.<br><br>Hello to the exact opposite of what you\u2019re going for with all that self-improvement.<br><br>And then, just for added fun, you also fail at self-acceptance (another should.) Because how can anyone be self-accepting while simultaneously trying to make themselves \u201cbetter?\u201d<br><br>This is crazy making stuff. It starts to make sense why so many people are unhappy.<br><br>Self improvement is an unwinnable game.<br><br>And with the constant mass-hypnosis of memes and \u201cYou should think like this\u201d self-help books, blogs, and motivational articles, you might be forgiven for missing\u2026<br><br>that reaching the goal of repaired and fixed You may not even be possible. I mean, who\u2019s vulnerable, forgiving, honest and open minded, all the time?<br><br>Really, who would even want to be? <em>(If in doubt, maybe start with just forgiving and being more vulnerable to Donald Trump right now.)<\/em><br><br>More relevantly, what never seems to get asked while the focus is on how to be better, is...<br><br>Should you be improved, at all?<br><br>After all, existence gives all of us this incredible buffet ... 7-billion diverse experiences and flavors and styles of human... and we in our arrogance say, \u201cNo! We should only be honest! We should only make a difference! Only open-minded, only brave, only vulnerable is acceptable. Anything else is bad and Not. Good. Enough.\u201d<br><br>Humans are constantly saying<em>&nbsp;NO<\/em> to existence as it is. We\u2019re constantly insisting we know better than existence how things should be.<br><br>Meanwhile, no one seems to notice whether all those should\u2019s actually succeed in fixing anything anyway. I mean, ask any addict if, \u201c<em>You shouldn\u2019t do that!\u201d<\/em> ever kept them from doing that. Or even check in yourself...did reading the meme above telling you to \u201c<em>Be honest\u201d<\/em> actually make you honest? <em>(Be honest now )<\/em><br><br>Such silliness. Just to keep you from noticing what you actually are.<br><br>Because really, let\u2019s say it\u2019s true and you\u2019re really not vulnerable enough, not following your heart enough, not feeling complete on your own. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s true that there\u2019s tons of need for improvement in little ol\u2019 you.<br><br>Ok. So?<br><br>Is there not room on this planet for the less-than-perfect? Is it really worth a lifetime of fixing what might be just fine as is, even if it's broken and incomplete?<br><br>Could it be that improving the present is... unnecessary?<br><br>Ok then, so, what to do? Should there be no shoulds?<br><br>Well, it seems there should be.<br><br>Because \"People shouldn\u2019t should on themselves\" is just more of the same, more fixing, more barely disguised You\u2019re-not-doing-it-right-itis.<br><br>Luckily there\u2019s no need to change all the Fix-You messages, because after all, what for? Besides, there are sooo many; there\u2019s no way to stop them even if you wanted to.<br><br>The messages can be noticed, though. You can notice the non-stop, not-even-hidden messages everywhere.<br><br>You might find that it feels better to see the Make-It-Better game in all its ever-present glory. Not because it shouldn\u2019t be played, but because seeing the game can shift the game. Without any <em>should<\/em> trying to force change.<br><br>And you <em>can<\/em> notice if what you are is so gosh-darned awful. Unimproved. As you are.<br><br>Now<em>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<\/em>might be a make-a-difference experience. That might even be<em>&nbsp;(gasp)<\/em> fun. And fun doesn\u2019t need fixing.<br><br>And oh my gosh, you might even notice what\u2019s here and what isn\u2019t, and that those are just synonyms for \u201cpresence.\u201d<br><br>Maybe AS IT IS is AS IT SHOULD BE. &nbsp;And has always been, all this time.<br><br>Wow. Talk about making a difference.","extra":""}
