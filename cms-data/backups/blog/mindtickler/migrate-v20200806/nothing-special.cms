Quite a few, actually.<br><br>They\u2019re overwhelmed by depression, failure, anger. They're despairing of ever being different, and often suicidal. They feel stuck and hopeless.<br><br>Some have had awakening experiences, which you might think would mean they\u2019d be peaced out and happy. But no. &nbsp;Interestingly, often, many feel worse. Because for them, everything is not only painful, it\u2019s also meaningless.<br><br>No matter what the specifics of these personal stories, all are convinced they\u2019re particularly messed up, screwed up and hopeless.<br><br>Ouch.<br><br>And then I go and tell them what they\u2019re experiencing is\u2026 common.<br><br>Not because I\u2019m unsympathetic.<br><br>But because when you hear from as many folks as I do, you begin to see the repetitive pattern of mind at work.<br><br>Comments become\u2026 predictable.<br><br>Almost like I\u2019m psychic or something. <br><br>Which of course I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve just heard all this before. Many times.<br><br>Because it turns out\u2026<br><br>Suffering has a script.<br><br>A repeated word-for-word, all-over-the-world-people-say-the-same-things, script.<br><br>The specific external circumstances are not at all the same of course.<br><br>But the conclusions and self referencing\u2026 oh yes.<br><br>Predictable down to the word.<br><br>All these very unique sufferers are saying...<br><br>All the same very not-unique things.<br><br>It becomes obvious how unoriginal the mind is.<br><br>All while insisting how original and unique we are.<br><br>You\u2019d think people who feel painfully isolated might be thrilled to learn that they\u2019re not alone, and not unique.<br><br>But actually no. They are not pleased.<br><br>They argue for their special messed-upness.<br><br>They are disbelieving. Skeptical.<br><br>Almost annoyed.<br><br>\u201cNo way!\u201d they all say. \u201cMy case is different. Other people don\u2019t suffer like this. Other people aren\u2019t this messed up. It\u2019s me. I\u2019m different.\u201d<br><br>Of the 7 billion people on this rock, they know that they are especially pained, especially hopeless, especially broken.<br><br>An especially alone-in-the-world loser.<br><br>Ok honey, sure.<br><br>What\u2019s up with that insistence on individuality and special-ness?<br><br>Oh we humans do love this uniqueness thing, don\u2019t we?<br><br>We love the idea of poor-me-the-special-failure-in-the-universe.<br><br>We love the constant refrain of \u201cI\u2019m me, I\u2019m a person, I\u2019m unique, I\u2019m real, I\u2019m bad, I am I am I am.\u201d<br><br>We love the, \u201cI am not like the others over there, I\u2019m this loser over here,\u201d song.<br><br>And we sing it all the time.<br><br>Oh yes it hurts like a sum\u2019bitch.<br><br>Painful stuff, being a person.<br><br>But judging by how hard folks insist that they are a special problem,<br><br>It is clear that pain, miserable as it is...<br><br>Is preferred to the possibility that we\u2019re not the least bit special, not unique, and\u2026<br><br>Not even individual at all.<br><br>Yeah, no thanks. Shut the hell up about person-hood,<br><br>And pass the tissues and the anti-depressants.<br><br>But\u2026.<br><br>If we can think for a moment about our own painful situations in life-<br><br>not enough success or love or enlightenment or friends or health or whatever-<br><br>If it was possible to look at these life situations without thinking this means something about us\u2026 or has anything to do with us,<br><br>Notice what happens to the pain?<br><br>It hurts less.<br><br>Often a lot less.<br><br>Huh.<br><br>Same exact situations.<br><br>Without the meaning about one\u2019s self- the self-referencing, the self-monitoring, the self-recrimination, it\u2019s\u2026<br><br>Easier.<br><br>So it\u2019s not the situations that are causing all this pain.<br><br>It\u2019s the individuality.<br><br>The self-ness. The unique person-ness of it.<br><br>That\u2019s what hurts.<br><br>Because is any one a distinct individual?<br><br>A unique, separate person?<br><br>It certainly looks like that\u2019s the case, of course.<br><br>And many of us do go with what it looks like and answer \"Yes!\"<br><br>But is that accurate?<br><br>Because a wave on the ocean looks like it is a distinct thing too, but is it indeed actually separate from the ocean?<br><br>No.<br><br>Think people are different from waves?<br><br>What if all the pain of everyday life, all the suffering, all the despair that everyone experiences...<br><br>Is entirely about the insistence that we are a Me, a person, a unique individual?<br><br>When what we really are, actually, is part of a crowd?<br><br>Ordinary.<br><br>Indistinguishable from others.<br><br>So blended in and the same and alike that we\u2019re literally\u2026<br><br>The same stuff.<br><br>Could it be that we\u2019re all\u2026no more than a wave?<br><br>A perceived-to-be-separate-but-not-actually-separate-from-the-sea-of-humanity wave?<br><br>We might watch what happens to suffering if that\u2019s the case.<br><br>And what happens to \u201cI\u2019m all alone in the world\u201d isolation, if we\u2019re just a small part of something\u2026 bigger.<br><br>Then we\u2019re not alone.<br><br>We\u2019re huge.<br><br>Connected.<br><br>Vast.<br><br>Unlimited.<br><br>Never-ending.<br><br>Failure becomes a meaningless concept.<br><br>Because how can vastness be a failure?<br><br>Only an individual can be a failure.<br><br>We might notice how that possibility feels.<br><br>We might see that when we peel away all the ideas of separateness, all the ideas that a Me is what does things and messes up and blows it\u2026<br><br>Then fault falls away too. As does blame. And shame. And regret.<br><br>All that pain that comes with the delusion of the person, falls away.<br><br>It\u2019s\u2026.<br><br>Calmer.<br><br>So yes, individuals hurt.<br><br>But thankfully an individual is not what we are.<br><br>No matter how much it appears so.<br><br>And though we may never come to know our own connectedness, our own ocean-ness,<br><br>Still... known or not... there it is.<br><br>Not apart, not separate, not bordered, not contained.<br><br>So the next time feelings of despair overtake us,<br><br>Maybe we can ride out that wave.<br><br>Knowing it isn\u2019t\u2026<br><br>Person-al.<br>","extra":""}
