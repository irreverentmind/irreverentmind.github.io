But what about me?\"<br>--Seekers<\/em><br><br><br>This is one of those seemingly light Mind-Ticklers which discusses the not-grand, but perhaps may be helpful and practical anyway.<br><br>It\u2019s a subject that probably gets in the way of what you want all the time.<br><br>A subject you think you already know.<br><br>But you don\u2019t.<br><br>Because maybe you\u2019re doing some form of inquiry but feel stuck on the hard stuff. Or maybe you\u2019re doing your best to \u201csit with feelings\u201d but it\u2019s uncomfortable.<br><br>Or maybe you\u2019re seeking an understanding of nonduality or consciousness and reality or yourself, but there\u2019s still more to get.<br><br>Or maybe you understand no-self but there\u2019s still a sense that HELLOOO, you\u2019re RIGHT HERE.<br><br>Very likely, my exploring friend, you are run by BUTs.<br><br>Those three letters own you.<br><br>Because they take you not where you want to go, but where they want to go.<br><br>Redirect, rerouting, sending you off on another direction.<br><br>The little rascals change the subject.<br><br>As if thought says, (belligerently, triumphantly,) \u201cOk I\u2019ll play along. But soon as I can I\u2019m going back to the way I do things. We\u2019re wasting our time here.\u201d &nbsp;<br><br>Which you probably know.<br><br>I mean it\u2019s common knowledge that Yes, but really means no. It's common knowledge that, pretending to add to the yes, BUT actually negates it.<br><br>BUTs essentially cancel the first part of their sentences.<br><br>\u201cIs it true? No, but it feels like it.\u201d<br><br>Um, okay.<br><br>So why is this so common that everyone does it, even while knowing better?<br><br>Because the mind\u2019s entire game is to hide the self\u2019s nonexistence. &nbsp;<br><br>It\u2019s a one trick pony, but it employs many strategies.<br><br>BUT is an easy, everybody-says-it-so-no-one-notices ploy.<br><br>Which is why there\u2019s a special kind of irony in exploring oneness-of-being in some way, while at the same time inserting BUT into every inquiry, every self examination, every meditation, every statement of feeling (except bad ones.)<br><br>Because BUT always equals two. Two viewpoints, two answers, two feelings, two thoughts.<br><br>So much for oneness.<br><br>Meanwhile, which is the answer? Is it true or isn\u2019t it? Is the feeling welcome or isn\u2019t it? Do you experience no-self or don\u2019t you?<br><br>There\u2019s only one answer. &nbsp;If truth exists, there\u2019s only one of it.<br><br>So it might be fun next time, to play with what an answer or understanding feels like, without tacking on a BUT (or any of its little friends: however, and, except, yet, and still)<br><br>What would understanding feel like without a BUT?<br><br>Now to be clear, this isn\u2019t about trying to stop BUT from coming.<br><br>That\u2019s not going to work anyway. Stopping thought is not in your power.<br><br>Instead, if you want to play with a different experience, tell the BUT to wait. Tell it to come back later.<br><br>Any feels-urgent-but-is-it BUT can wait 10 minutes.<br><br>And then you get to have the fun of seeing if it even bothers to return at all, once there\u2019s no longer a need to divert.<br><br>You get to see what it feels like to actually notice, attend to, and honor the first part of your answer...<br><br>The part said before the BUT came along to eliminate it.<br><br>\u201cI can\u2019t find the self.\u201d PERIOD.<br>\u201cThis feels better.\u201d PERIOD.<br>\u201cThis feeling is welcome.\u201d PERIOD.<br><br>I mean, who knows, maybe the usually strong sense of self, with all its many opinions and feelings,<br><br>might even begin to feel a little less solid, a little less tangible, a little less viable,<br><br>when BUT isn\u2019t given free reign to poop all over your answers and the first part of sentences.<br><br>Now granted, you may be thinking, \"But this is stupid. Asking the BUT to wait is too simple.\"<br><br>And maybe you're right.<br><br>But in that case it's no big deal to try it, and there\u2019s not much to lose, is there.<br><br>Or it could turn out that maybe this is a very simple way to play with something more than book-learning, something more than intellectualized concepts which never do feel real for you.<br><br>Because till now, the BUTs haven\u2019t let them.<br><br>But there\u2019s only one way out find out.<br><br><br><em><strong>Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<br>Click here to watch Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump<\/strong><\/em><br><br><br><em>\"The fool will laugh at you, but the wise man will understand.\u201d<br>--Linji Yixuan<br><br>----------<br><br>\u201cIt may seem we're on a path, but we are always back where we started.\u201d<br>--Rupert Spira<br><br>----------<br><br>\"I know you\u2019re tired but come, this is the way.\"<br>--Rumi<img src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/ghost-1635771936.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width: 23.19%;\"><\/em><br><br><br>","extra":""}
