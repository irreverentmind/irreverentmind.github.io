You must agree that I am especially a problem, it\u2019s worse for me than for anyone else. I am the only one, or at least I\u2019m worse than everyone else. I am NOT normal.\u201d<br><br>Some version of this script might sound familiar.<br><br>That would be because, despite what thought says,<br><br>you\u2019re just like the rest of us.<br><br>Which is, y\u2019know, another way of saying \u201cnormal.\u201d<br><br>Which may or may not be believed.<br><br>So what does it mean, anyway? What makes something not normal?<br><br>Let\u2019s ask Mr. Dictionary.<br><br><em>Normal: conforming to a type, standard, or regular pattern: characterized by that which is considered usual, typical, or routine.<br><\/em><br>Hmmm, apparently it\u2019s about numbers, comparing to a \u201ctype.\u201d<br><br>Normal requires others.
