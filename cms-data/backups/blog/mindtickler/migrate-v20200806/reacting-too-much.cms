As you know. And maybe wish was otherwise.","words":677,"content":"Reactions.<br><br><br>They happen.<br><br><br>As you know. And maybe wish was otherwise.<br><br><br>Like it or not though, all people react.<br><br><br>Animals do too.<br><br><br>What an odd human notion that that shouldn\u2019t happen.<br><br><br>As if we\u2019re supposed to stay calm at all times. &nbsp;Here is this amazing cornucopia of experiences available to us, and we only want the smiley ones.<br><br><br>So many in the spiritual community think reactions shouldn\u2019t happen and that they indicate a lack of evolution.<br><br><br>But that\u2019s not a particularly spiritual or evolved point of view, is it? Disapproval of the uncontrollable is typical and business as usual for most people, spiritual or not.<br><br><br>And really, why shouldn\u2019t reactions happen?<br><br><br>Other than thoughts like, \u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t handle it\u201d.<br><br><br>It\u2019s just a reaction. Not the plague.<br><br><br>And of course thought lies, anyway. Because we can handle it. Look at how many times we've thought, \u201dI can\u2019t take it!\u201d and then\u2026 we took it. Lived through it. Went on. Life went on.<br><br><br>Thinking takes a sensation, calls it \"bad\" and \"too much,\" and amplifies it with commentary and discussion about whether it\u2019s liked or not, good or not.<br><br><br>But when a loud noise scares my cat, she doesn\u2019t debate if she likes it or if she\u2019d be a better cat if she didn\u2019t get scared. She just reacts with fear, jumps, runs, and then\u2026<br><br><br>It\u2019s over.<br><br><br>Next.<br><br><br>Anyway, pssst- little secret- it doesn\u2019t matter if we like it.<br><br><br>Because existence offers us this amazing roller coaster ride. And even though we spend the whole trip insisting it should flatten out\u2026<br><br><br>Existence runs this ride, not we silly humans. So we're spared the worry of being bored to death.<br><br><br>Perhaps we could consider what it would be like if the evaluation about reaction, or the certainty that it means something about our awfulness and need of repair, were to magically be gone?<br><br><br>What if it was OK to hiss, get our fur up, and be done with it? Without having to inquire or meditate or medicate or satsang the reaction away?<br><br><br>Life might be simpler. Life might be kinder. Life might be calmer.<br><br><br>Which ironically is what we\u2019re after in the first place.<br><br><br>And even if thought then helpfully adds, \u201cBut there are consequences- like losing a job or hurting someone else\u201d ...<br><br>We might first notice that others can handle their reactions too, just like we can.<br><br>And then we might also look back and see that, frequently, the consequences that seemed at the time to most certainly be bad things, turned out with hindsight to be good things, not bad.<br><br><br>So all that avoidance of consequences that runs our lives- well, maybe that\u2019s not necessary either.<br><br><br>Maybe reacting is just not a big deal.<br><br>Maybe none of it matters.<br><br><br>In which case\u2026 &nbsp;ahhh. That sure takes a whole lot of work off the table, doesn\u2019t it?<br><br><br>Then we might get to experience life in all its flavors. Without trying to limit, contain or flatten it.<br><br><br>Which interestingly, sounds like one way of describing ... presence.<br><br><br>Something so many spiritual seekers are striving for.<br><br><br>Wouldn\u2019t it be something if it was right here all along, right here on the vast and never-ending reaction-buffet, just waiting to be consumed and enjoyed with gusto.<br><br><br>Bon appetit.<br><br><br>\u200b<br>","extra":""}
