As in, reeeeallly pissed them off. As in, relationship-ending pissed them off.<br><br>Over something that would seem to be barely worth the words about it.<br><br>And yet somehow there were plenty of words. Ugly, nasty, can\u2019t-take-\u2018em back words.<br><br>At first I was shocked, bewildered. I couldn\u2019t see how to jive what I was hearing with my own experience of our times together.<br><br>Because according to this family member, I have been a terrible, unlovable, demeaning, entitled and cruel-for-years person.<br><br>Naturally, defensiveness rose up. &nbsp;<br><br>In knows-better-than-this moi. &nbsp;<br><br><em>What! They\u2019re calling me a person?! I\u2019m outraged!<\/em><br><br>Well okay that wasn\u2019t quite it. But still,<br><br>For a while, defense seemed <em>necessary.<\/em><br><br>Danger! Sirens! Strobes! Protection from this clearly... terrible... threat! These... um...<br><br>Words.<br><br>Insert eye roll emoji here.<br><br>Yes, thankfully, seeing that there\u2019s no legitimate or literal threat does calm things a bit.<br><br>But the compulsion to defend and protect is strong.<br><br>Because, y\u2019know, <em>compulsion.<\/em><br><br>After all, we\u2019ve spent a lifetime carefully crafting a story of who and what we are, curating identity into something that we can live with.<br><br>We can\u2019t have someone come along and turn all that careful image-building work to nothing.<br><br>That won't do.<br><br>So these identity stories <em>require<\/em> defense. It's not optional.<br><br>So F that crazy family member and their out-of-the blue finger-pointing.<br><br>Although funny thing about relationship messes - only perceived separate individuals can get into them.<br><br>Because what are relationships, if not the business of connecting with other individual persons who, amazingly enough, also have an identity to protect?<br><br>So everyone runs around projecting the preferred tale of their individuality and predilections and tolerances onto any body that has the misfortune to be nearby.<br><br>Making relationships mighty tricky stuff.<br><br>As of course anyone who has ever known any other human being already knows.<br><br>And then adding to the fun, since humans can\u2019t see anything without filters,<br><br>In particular the filter that we\u2019re individuals, &nbsp;<br><br>It\u2019s impossible to not project.<br><br>Which means we can never know who\u2019s \u201cright\u201d. &nbsp;Even though we\u2019re positive we do know.<br><br>What a lovely field for mind\u2019s very favorite ploy-<br><br><em>Drum up a good drama in order to reify the sense of self!<\/em><br><br>Ignore the filters, defend the image, protect and maintain the self story at all times, and work up a good outrage.<br><br>All while nothing is actually threatened, and nothing actually needs protection.<br><br>Oh it just loves this stuff.<br><br>Luckily for us though, if we can see through this, it\u2019s a much less angry, dangerous world. &nbsp;<br><br>Because whether we retreat to a cave and isolate, or party on down in constant company,<br><br>We are still...<br><br>Consciousness experiencing itself.<br><br>Which makes us all the same stuff. All the same intangible vapor.<br><br>And already connected to itself.<br><br>Which is why human relationship may or may not appear to be severed, but connection can\u2019t ever be.<br><br>Because we are literally them. There\u2019s no way to sever that.<br><br>And gratefully, truly seeing this leaves only compassion for the partners, children, coworkers, friends, parents,<br><br>For the autopilot defenses, armaments, preservations, and outrages,<br><br>And for all the beauty in suffering...<br><br>That comes with thinking we\u2019re a person.<br><br>A person somehow <em>able<\/em> to be disconnected and cut off from others.<br><br>Instead of the vast unlimited connectedness we already have,<br><br>And already<br><br>Are.<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled <\/a>every week.<br><br><em>\"There is no me or you.
