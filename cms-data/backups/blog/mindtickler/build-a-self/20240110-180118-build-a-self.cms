No fear is so small or petty that the fear of no-self isn't at its heart. All fear is ultimately fear of no-self.\"<br>--Jed McKenna<\/em><br><br><br>-----<br><br>As my holiday gift to you, I thought it might be nice to learn how to build a self. Kinda like Build-a-Bear, just not quite as cuddly.<br><br>Because what better gift than creating a you to BE. Since of course there must be a you.<br><br>1) So start by locating the self. In order for you to exist, you have to be somewhere. This requires you to be a thing, an object. Being a thing fills space, avoiding scary emptiness and nothingness.<br><br>In fact, cover all bases and create an \u201cinside\u201d, too. Call that \u201cinner you,\u201d your True Self.<br><br>It\u2019s changeable, though- the Inner Self\u2019s thoughts and feelings vary with the weather. So it can\u2019t really be the True one. But still.<br><br>Creating this inner you enables there to now be 2 somethings, a true and a false self. Yay for extra emptiness-filling!<br><br>Even better, now the inside can be filled up with alcohol and food and an inner child requiring unending attention and problem solving.<br><br>Nice!<br><br>2) There must be a past. There has to be a creation backstory. \u201cHere I am, and this is how I got here.\u201d Tell that story on repeat. Memorize, reinforce, re-live. Use thoughts and images both mental and physical to prove veracity.<br><br>Like #1, this also locates and places you. Without a story of a past, there\u2019s no way to exist as anything more than a fleeting current experience (as opposed to an experiencER.) There can simply be no you without the past. So replay for a lifetime, the tale of what is long gone.<br><br>If it was ever there.<br><br>3) Build in importance. Make self the center of everything- dreams, situations, memories, thoughts. Keep attention on this important thing at all times. Support its significance with fault, guilt, blame, shame, and responsibility. Because hey, Important-You made the mess, Important-You must fix it.<br><br>4) Evaluate. Monitor and keep your eye on the self. How\u2019s it doing? Is it OK? Is it good enough? Did it do the right thing, does it know what it\u2019s doing, does it need more enlightenment, does it need fixing? Well of course it does. Perfect. Get to fixin.<br><br>Evaluate and watch your own self,&nbsp;with&nbsp;that very same self. Notice who it\u2019s up to, to find and solve the problems of self.<br><br>5) Monitor others\u2019 thoughts too. Y\u2019know, about&nbsp;you.&nbsp;(see #3.) After all, their thoughts have the power to \u201cmake you\u201d upset or happy. Which means&nbsp;their&nbsp;thoughts make&nbsp;you.&nbsp;So regardless of logic or lack thereof, monitor: \u201dDo they like me? Did I impress them, do they think I\u2019m smart, talented, attractive? Do they see me, get me, admire me?\u201d<br><br>5a) Attempt to control what others think. About you in particular. Find ways to fool them so they don\u2019t discover you\u2019re a loser, weak, unlovable, or a failure who never came close to reaching full potential. Whatever that is.<br><br>This way, \u201cI\u2019m right about me because others see me and think so too\u201d can be used as further proof of your existence. Never mind those others have an equally urgent investment in believing in you, just like you believe in them.<br><br>6) Compare. \u201cAre those others better than I am? Am I ugly compared to them, unliked compared to them, weird, less talented, less enlightened compared to them?\u201d Comparing tells you who you are.<br><br>Because that\u2019s what everything\u2019s about.<br><br>7) Make the body\u2019s senses top priority. See it to believe it. Hear it. Feel those feelings. Surely that contraction in the chest or that dislike of sadness proves something. How do you know you exist? You see, hear, feel.<br><br>8) See your self as uniquely suffering, with flaws which are obviously worse than others\u2019. Insist on that uniqueness (\u201cI\u2019m not like other people, I\u2019m weird, others may also be anxious but mine is worse,\u201d) while simultaneously striving extra-hard to be \u201cnormal,\u201d and part of some crowd. The right enlightenment group, the right political side, the right sports team. Be part of a tribe, a family of like-minded others.<br><br>Because sure you may esteem being special and different but after all, there\u2019s safety in numbers.<br><br>9) Try to live up to concepts like meaning, purpose, goals, goodness, rightness, and potential. I\u2019s not clear exactly what these things are- I mean, they\u2019re not even things- but they seem to be necessary.<br><br>10) Resist with all you\u2019ve got, anything and everything that might have potential to help see through the mist, the fa\u00e7ade, the fakery of all this. Claim to want to understand while arguing fiercely, angrily, dismissively, that of course you exist, you\u2019re RIGHT HERE!<br><br>Let fear and annoyance and looking in all the wrong places deter you from noticing nothingness.<br><br>After noticing that fear shows up anytime&nbsp;possible emptiness begins to be sensed,(\"Oh this is scary!), ask, \"Then what IS there? What\u2019s real? What am I?\u201d Get stuck there.<br><br>Certainly don\u2019t notice or wait for what might come&nbsp;just after.<br><br>Ok, so, fine. Do you ever have to get this? Do you ever have to stop building this bear?<br><br>Of course not. Absolutely nothing needs the self to know whether it\u2019s real or not.<br><br>Besides, whatever you are, you are already that anyway.<br><br>Known or not, understood or not, seen or not, you\u2019re still whatever you are.<br><br>Which may or may not turn out to be nothing.<br><br>Luckily, nothing cares.<br><br>So you may as well enjoy being a well-built and cuddly bear.<br><br>And maybe not much else.<br><br><img src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/553ec1c9-ead6-79fd-8afe-fde7fea8540b.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width: 25%;\"><br><img align=\"center\" alt=\"\" src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/1704909653801.jpg\" width=\"182\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\"><br>","extra":"","extra2":""}
