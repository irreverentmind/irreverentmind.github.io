Hence, \u201cclass.\u201d<br><br>There are many professional artists in the class. Their work is spectacular. Of course, the course info is new for them too. But they\u2019re not producing sh*te, the way some others are.&nbsp;<em>*cough*<\/em><br><br>We are supposed to post our work.<br><br>I don\u2019t want to.<br><br>Let\u2019s face it, my results suck. No I mean really. I mean ok yes I\u2019ve been painting most of my life and yes I am good with being in the learner\u2019s position.<br><br>But still.<br><br>The mind\u2019s usual evaluation of performance leaps into high gear. It finds mine quite lacking.<br><br>How can I put such ridiculousness out there for anyone to see?<br><br>Though I do notice that even the pros who are posting magnificence are&nbsp;alsomaking, \u201cIt\u2019s not very good,\u201d apologies. In fact, every one&nbsp;of the class posts has some sort of head-down-toe-digging-into-the-dirt, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s awful,\u201d commentary.<br><br>So, pushing against the urge to hide, I posted. Though I couldn\u2019t resist stating the obvious and obligatory, \u201cUgh\u201d along with it.<br><br>And then I got a few compliments.<br><br>Oh <em>HELL<\/em> no, now we\u2019re going too far.<br><br>There\u2019s already plenty of pretending going on. Do not make me have to do more.<br><br>Do not make me have to smile and say, \u201cYou think so? Oh thank you so much!\u201d instead of crawling away snarling. Do not ask me to pretend this shite is good. Instead, let\u2019s point out how it sucks. LOOK! Look at this mess!<br><br>Do not compliment the self. We hate the self. Do not encourage it.<br><br>Especially in performance situations.<br><br>And let\u2019s face it, every life situation is a performance situation.<br><br>Because for the entirety of our lives, humans package the self to try to make it look good.<br><br>We try to make it look sexy or kind or confidant. We try to make it look not too visibly crazy or depressed or scared or miserable. In those times when things are good, we try to make it look not too proud, too happy, too \u201cfull of ourselves.\u201d<br><br>The self is concerned with image. It\u2019s performative. It\u2019s acting. It\u2019s hiding. It\u2019s pretending.<br><br>Always.<br><br>We call it performance anxiety for a reason.<br><br>All we want is for others to buy the act.<br><br>But then life situations keep providing opportunity to risk exposure of the fakery. The sports competition, the speech or concert, having to read our paper in front of the class. Even a smile at someone in the grocery store can be cause for analytical self-review.<br><br><em>Did I pull this off?<\/em><br><br>And to make it worse, the outcome is never under our control. We may give the concert and get everything right, or miss a few notes despite relentless practice\u2014 we don't know, we have to wait and see how it goes, because neither result is in our hands.<br><br>Which is why so many people walk around with some level of anxiety.<br><br>I mean, here the whole act depends on our presenting a good image, and it turns out we have no control over it.<br><br>This can be terrifying.<br><br>And the thing is, while thought busily focuses on the content of the show- whether the leg lines are good or if the whoosh of the ball is right- hardly anyone seems to notice what is&nbsp;really&nbsp;being hidden by all that fear of performing badly.<br><br>We think it's some version of,&nbsp;<em>I\u2019m messed up and not good enough and have to hide this,<\/em> that we\u2019re afraid of exposing.<br><br>When it\u2019s not that at all.<br><br>It\u2019s exposure of nothing-but-a-concept, pretending to be a real something.<br><br>In every moment, we risk being seen- not for what we are, but for what we are not.<br><br>Mind tells all of us that it\u2019s our non-adequacy and non-goodness which needs to be hidden,<br><br>Instead of our non-existence.<br><br>This is partly how thought creates reality.<br><br>A conveniently painful \u201creality\u201d which comes with imposter syndrome and a desperation to fix the self so it can fall into line better.<br><br>No individual is exempt from this.<br><br>Because no matter how much we play-act, humans will always be nothing, faking at being something.<br><br>So maybe instead of pretending otherwise, we can <em>expect&nbsp;<\/em>to feel like frauds.<br><br><em>Expect&nbsp;<\/em>the usual sense of never-enoughness.<br><br><em>Expect<\/em> to be afraid.<br><br>Always.<br><br>Maybe at least that, we don\u2019t have to hide.<br><br>Maybe at least that, we are doing perfectly.<br><br>No matter how<br><br>we act.<br><br>----------<br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<br><\/strong><\/a><strong><br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yjGT9pciLDw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Watch Judy and Shiv Sengupta discuss spiritual anarchy<\/a><br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&t=6s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to watch Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump<\/a><br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7RTsMwHqu3Q\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click to watch Judy and Walter have fun chatting about about<br>nonduality, the self, consciousness, awareness, free will<br>and other light and breezy stuff<\/a><br><br><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BAa3UCEyROQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Judy And Robert Saltzman talk nonduality<\/strong><\/a><br>and https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7fv_vsvaejs<br>and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3DAn8Rqg3I0\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3DAn8Rqg3I0<\/a><br>----------<br><br><em>\u201cAll fear is the fear of no-self.\u201d<br>--Jed McKenna<br><br>----------<br><br>\u201cWhatever the image of yourself, it\u2019s a mask and it\u2019s hiding emptiness.\u201d<br>--Adyashanti<br><br>----------<br><br>\"Are you willing to risk<br>Everything, to be<br>Totally and utterly exposed?<br>Are you willing to see<br>How you defraud,<br>Demean and trivialize<br>The totality of your being<br>By relegating it to<br>This psychosomatic device<br>Called you?<br>The ability to discriminate<br>Between what appears to be and<br>What-Is is<br>The mark of the wise...\"<br>wu'hsin<br><\/em><br><img align=\"center\" alt=\"\" src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/1653515316252.jpg\" width=\"282.8\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 18%;\"><br><br><img align=\"center\" alt=\"\" src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/1653515327342.jpg\" width=\"179.36\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 17%;\"><br>","extra":"","extra2":""}
