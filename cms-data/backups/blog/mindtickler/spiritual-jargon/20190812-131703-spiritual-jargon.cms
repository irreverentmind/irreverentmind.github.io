The kinds of words that enlighten just by reading them.<br><br>Those kinds of words.<br><br>Which is why today, just for balance, The Mind-Tickler will be brought to you by the Non-Dual Jargon Association.<br><br>Herewith, some random quotes from various sources, some very well known, though unattributed so you can receive them with an open mind.<br><br>We shall cross fingers that just reading this properly-written material, as opposed to the usual mind-tickles, will bring about that long-sought-after shift.<br><br>Here goes.<br><br><em>\u201cWhen one Awakens unto Pure Awareness, one Awakens unto the Presence of Pure Awareness \u2013 Now. Such Presence is of Pure Awareness, not of Mind, and Pure Awareness is what is Aware.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHaving become non-dual with respect to awareness and the Clear, ie awareClear, one becomes non-dual with respect to awareClear and appearances of whatever nature.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhen for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen, only the heard in reference to the heard, only the sensed in reference to the sensed, only the cognized in reference to the cognized, then, there is no you in connection with that. When there is no you in connection with that, there is no you there. When there is no you there, you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two.\u201d<br><\/em><br>Want more? Of course you do! The desire for this stuff is apparently unlimited in the spiritual community.<br><br><em>\u201cThe recognition of clear awareness as our own essence informs our pursuit of practices in the gradual cultivation of our being\u2026 We arrive at rest in the non-dual wholeness of awareness. Purity of being, awareness, promotes the purification of our will, the letting go of attachments and egoism.\u201d<br><br>\u201cBeing is the consummate absence that is beyond measure.\u201d<br><br>\u201cUltimate Clarity only occurs when attachments to ANY and ALL concepts that arise in Consciousness are completely done away, and in that vacuum or space\u2026 Pure Awareness IS.\u201d<br><br>\u201c *The experience* of *being* enlightened courses through one's body of awareness.\u201d<\/em><br><br><em>\u201cTo be Present in Consciousness is not to be separate from that which arises in Consciousness, but is to be Present in All that appears in Consciousness. Presence must accompany that which arises in Consciousness for Conscious Awareness to occur.\u201d<br><br>\u201cMy ego was gone- there was just me there.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAwareness is Aware.\u201d<br><\/em><br>OK! Got it?<br><br>Feeling awareClear yet? &nbsp;Is the cognized, cognized?<br><br>Sure, sure.<br><br>Now, I\u2019m not saying that any of this is right or wrong.<br><br>It\u2019s just that, from here, all that gobble-de-gook passing for communication sure seems like obfuscation.<br><br>It sure seems possible that all those almost-nonsensical strung-together words just maybe... just might... maintain the sense of seeking and finding the self.<br><br>Instead of setting folks free of it. Instead of enabling the enlightenment that people are bothering with all those words for in the first place.<br><br>Because jargon interferes. Jargon obscures. Jargon categorizes, distances, eliminates, and encloses in small, Right-Way boxes.<br><br>Which happens to be the opposite of mind-opening awareness.<br><br>But hey, what do I know?<br><br>Nisargadatta I ain\u2019t. &nbsp;<br><br>Still, there you go, hopefully feeling wiser for all those quotes.<br><br>You\u2019re welcome.<br><br>May you rest in non-dual beingness.<br><br>May you shift into, and abide in, blissful everlasting awareness.<br><br>May perpetual, not-affected-by-outside-circumstances peace be with you.<br><br>Oh and love!
