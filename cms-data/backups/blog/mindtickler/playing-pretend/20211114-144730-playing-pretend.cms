Let\u2019s put on a show in the barn!\u201d &nbsp;There was a lot of playacting, a lot of singing into hairbrushes, a lot of posturing in front of mirrors.<br><br>Grown up now, pretending continues, just not nearly so obviously.<br><br>To be clear, I\u2019m not talking about lying or being inauthentic or showing off.<br><br>I\u2019m talking about the very basic, completely inherent, everywhere-all-the-time impersonating that every single human does, every single day, 24\/7.<br><br>Human lives are built on pretend.<br><br>Hoodwinking ourselves to believe obviously illusory stuff is partly why so many of us often feel like something isn\u2019t right, or something is missing, or we did the wrong thing, etc.<br><br>We sense the counterfeit and it doesn\u2019t sit right.<br><br>Don\u2019t believe me? &nbsp;Great, let\u2019s see.<br><br>We\u2019ll start small.<br><br>Let\u2019s talk about the literal review we do, like any critic after a Broadway show, evaluating our performance after any social situation or work event. \u201cUgh, did I say the wrong thing? Did I upset them? Did I do well, did I impress them, did I behave like a fool? What do the reviewers think of me?\u201d<br><br>Let\u2019s notice we use the word \u201cperformance.\u201d for these situations.<br><br>The Me, star of every show. Singing into the hairbrush for the critics.<br><br>Or going a bit bigger now, how about everybody\u2019s favorite- feelings. What are they, anyway? They\u2019re not actually findable in the body. No surgeon has ever scooped out anxiety and said, \u201cOk, got it all, close \u2018er up.\u201d Humiliation doesn\u2019t have a location, love isn\u2019t hanging out in a place inside, sadness is not in a closet somewhere. &nbsp;It just feels like they\u2019re there. They're not literally there.<br><br>Or continuing with anxiety, have you ever noticed it comes up after rough or scary situations? It happens later, when we\u2019re safe, and sitting in our favorite chair or lying in our own bed, scared about something that isn\u2019t happening.<br><br>As if we\u2019re practicing fear for later. Y\u2019know, as in, rehearsing.<br><br>And how about love? We love pretending that it\u2019s about someone else. Until we notice it\u2019s a feeling of ours. And most often, love only happens if it has to do with us. &nbsp;\u201cYou make me feel so good. You make me feel like my best self. You\u2019re my best friend. You\u2019re there for me.\u201d<br><br>Love is also about The Me. We just pretend it\u2019s about someone else.<br><br>Or, still searching for anything that is not pretend or imagination, how about money? Money's a real, touchable thing, right?<br><br>Except that, once upon a time, humans arbitrarily choose one metal out of all the metals on earth to stand for money, to represent or symbolize money.<br><br>Even though a symbol isn\u2019t something real. It's an idea. A made-up, everybody-plays-along concept. \u201cWe shall all agree this gold hunk of metal stands for something important.\u201d<br><br>And then later, when lugging around metal got to be too much, everyone agreed to switch to paper, and now it\u2019s paper we pretend is valuable and important.<br><br>Don\u2019t even get me started on crypto.<br><br>Need more proof that we\u2019re living a pretend, illusory life?<br><br>How about time- past, present, future?<br><br>We live by the clock, another representation, although, of what, exactly? What is time?<br><br>And what a fun story- \"the past.\" &nbsp;It's already-gone time. It was here, called \u201cthe present,\u201d and now it\u2019s gone and renamed \u201cthe past.\u201d But where it\u2019s gone to is a mystery. &nbsp;Its existence is proven by images- colors on screen or paper- or by memory, that notorious who-knows-what which has been shown repeatedly to be almost always inaccurate. &nbsp;Even the word \u201chistory\u201d contains the word \u201cstory.\u201d &nbsp;<br><br>And of course there's the future- time yet to come. I wonder where it lives while it\u2019s waiting for its big moment on the stage. Does that moment ever come? Does the future ever arrive?<br><br>Or we could talk about furniture, trees, other people. Those must surely be real. But... they appear in our eyeballs, our ears, our fingertips. There's no proof they are outside The Me.<br><br>Oh dear. Could it be even others are still The Me, pretending to be something else?<br><br>Or look at the reality of self, personality, mind, thought, good, bad, right, wrong. Every bit of that is variable and dependent on context and situation and on what part of the planet we were born.<br><br>But nothing real varies based on location or context. If it\u2019s real, it\u2019s real no matter what.<br><br>Aw hell. Where\u2019s reality? &nbsp;Where\u2019s the not-illusion, the not-pretend?<br><br>Nowhere, man.<br><br>Illusion is where humans live. Playing pretend is what we do. We live in an agreed-on fantasy.<br><br>Even if we lived like Ramana in a cave, this would be the case.<br><br>So yay us! We get to act out stories and play pretend.<br><br>Like any little kid.<br><br>Musical numbers, swordfights and wars, tears, mistakes, laughter, love! Whoo hoo!<br><br>Yes we do know it\u2019s a game. We do know it\u2019s pretend.<br><br>We\u2019ve agreed to play the part.<br><br>Because it's fun.<br><br>I mean, aren't we lucky?<br><br>This show we\u2019re putting on in the barn is wild.<br><br><br><br><strong><em><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/a><\/em><\/strong><strong><em><br><\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&t=6s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Click to watch Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong><em><br><\/em><\/strong><br><em><br>\"No thought you have ever had is true.
