This labelling brings into existence the one who is translating this sensation.\"<br>-UG Krishnamurti<br><br>----------<br><br>\"The body is a safe refuge for the sense of 'me.' It is rarely discovered there.\"<br>--Rupert Spira<\/em><br><br><br>You wake with it in the morning. Or maybe it hits later in the day, or wakes you at night. If you succeed in making it out of bed, you lug it around, trying to force yourself to function.<br><br>Intense emotional pain. Depression, anxiety, panic. Sad. Heavy. Unbearable.<br><br>The mental loop runs, repeating the same blah blah blah word for word, all day, every day, over and over.<br>It's irresistible and can\u2019t be ignored.<br><br>\u201cFeel feel feel. Augh Augh Augh. Feels like this, feels like that. Don\u2019t like don\u2019t like don\u2019t like don't like. Make it stop make it stop make it stop. Somebody save me!\u201d<br><br>No saving comes.<br><br>Nothing works, there\u2019s no hope, you\u2019re obviously in trouble and beyond help or relief, you\u2019re a failure a loser broken bad deserving no better. No one has it as bad as you. At least try to hide how messed up you are from others.<br><br>Mind\u2019s attention constantly on the You. What you feel, what you don\u2019t want, what you can\u2019t handle, what you think caused it, and most importantly, what you think it means.<br><br>Y\u2019know, about you.<br><br>Who are you without it? Not a clue.<br><br>Which is probably why it hasn't been noticed that that feeling isn\u2019t actually there.<br><br>It\u2019s not in the body.<br><br>Yes, there\u2019s a sense of it. But that\u2019s just another feeling.<br><br>And yes it feels like it\u2019s in the body, as you point to solar plexus, stomach, head.<br><br>But in that case it should show up on an X-ray, an MRI, a CAT scan, light or heat sensor, shouldn't it?<br><br>Like every other body-thing does.<br><br>And then a surgeon should be able to go in and blessedly-thank-you-lord, scoop that sucker out and remove it. Thank you doctor, thank you!<br><br>But no.<br><br>This runs-your-life thing which is so intense, so obvious that no one could possibly question its reality because&nbsp;duh, could itbee it's not actually findable?<br><br>Could it be it\u2019s an illusion, an idea, a story, an intangible, unprovable concept- which isn\u2019t literally there?<br><br>Whaaat?<br><br>I mean, here's you and everyone else absolutely knowing that&nbsp;Of Course!feeling is in the body and&nbsp;Of Course!&nbsp;the body is where it needs to be dealt with, sat with, transcended, converted, managed, controlled, listened to, honored, respected, felllllllllt, and interpreted.<br><br>So it's a lifetime of trying to fix something that isn\u2019t where you're looking.<br><br>Trying to fix or feel something that is nothing.<br><br>And then wondering why you don\u2019t succeed.<br><br>Feelings aren\u2019t feelings. They\u2019re thoughts.<br><br>Perhaps this is why you want others to validate those feelings, going on and on and on to anyone who happens to stand still near you for more than a minute, endlessly describing how you feel.<br><br>Validate. As in&nbsp;make valid.&nbsp;As in, not valid already, it needs to be&nbsp;made&nbsp;valid. By somebody. Anybody.<br><br>But nothing real needs to be validated. Your shoes don\u2019t need to be validated, the cat doesn\u2019t need to be validated. Only feelings and the story of who you are want validation.<br><br>Not that the mind has been willing to let you notice any of this. That would mess up its,&nbsp;Of course I exist, look how much I hurt!&nbsp;gig.<br><br>The sense of self far prefers to focus on solving the terrible problem of terrible feelings, than to notice that they, and it, don\u2019t actually exist anywhere.<br><br>Turns out you\u2019re not actually defending against feelings. You\u2019re defending against the nonexistence of self.<br><br>You're just using \u201cfeelings\u201d to do that.<br><br>So ok fine, blah dee blah blah blah. Who cares? Real or not, it\u2019s called Painand it\u2019s awful. Real or not, something needs to be done.<br><br>Right?<br><br>And since that sense that something&nbsp;must&nbsp;be done is very strong, and since you\u2019re going to keep trying to do something about it anyway, you may as well try something different for a change.<br><br>So here are a couple ways to play with that feeling you love to hate, whether real or illusory.<br><br>Just for fun. Not intended to be \u201cThe answer\u201d or a miracle cure or even a cure at all.<br><br>Since nothing is sick and nothing needs healing.<br><br>1- Notice the timing, notice the WHEN.<br>Notice when your attention is called to a feeling. (The mind will say \u201cIt\u2019s all the time,\u201d but that is not true.) When you notice, \u201cOh crap I feel terrible,\u201d ask yourself, How am I using this situation to know who I am?<br><br>And then answer the question.<br><br>Because does any feeling- any contraction, any heaviness- make a person bad, a failure, unlovable? It\u2019s just a sensation. Does it have the ability to make a person, at all?<br><br>2- Ask, \"Why does it matter what I feel?\"<br>Take, \u201cI don\u2019t like it\u201d off the table, because nothing in the universe, I mean nothing, cares what anybody likes. And take, \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable\u201d off the table too, because that\u2019s different wording for just another feeling.<br><br>And then notice there\u2019s a ton of supposed meaning about who you are- as a person- laid on top of the feeling. Meaning is a concept though, a mind-concoction. Take that off too.<br><br>And then see&nbsp;what's left.<br><br>It could be that without all that dislike and meaning layered on top, intense feelings become remarkably... less-so. It could be they become just an interesting experience- a heaviness, a flutter, a dark color, a contraction.<br><br>Just like that.<br><br>Why does it matter if a feeling happens? What cares if a feeling happens on this earth?<br><br>Don\u2019t settle for \u201cMe, I care.\u201d Point to that. If you point to the body, see if skin, bones, blood, nostrils, elbows, heart muscle, care about anything at all, let alone some unfindable emotion.<br><br>It could be there\u2019s nothing to point to.<br><br>So that the question,&nbsp;Why does it matter what I feel?&nbsp;might open surprising new doors, if you\u2019re willing.<br><br>Which, of course, you may not be.<br><br>After all, the devil you know might be preferable to finding out about one you don\u2019t.<br><br>And that's fine. Just painful.<br><br>On the other hand, once&nbsp;don\u2019t like&nbsp;and meaning and importance are peeled off from sensation,<br><br>a quick and effective noticing<br><br>of something other than self<br><br>might suddenly happen.<br><br>And who knows?<br><br>That might&nbsp;feel<br><br>Pretty darn good.<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/strong><\/a><strong><br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yjGT9pciLDw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Watch Judy and Shiv Sengupta discuss spiritual anarchy<\/a><br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&t=6s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to watch Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump<\/a><br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7RTsMwHqu3Q\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watch Judy and Walter have fun chatting about about nonduality, the self, consciousness, awareness, free willand other light and breezy stuff<\/a><\/strong><br><br><strong>watch Judy and Robert Saltzman talk nonduality<\/strong><br>first:- - https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BAa3UCEyROQ<br>2nd: - -https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7fv_vsvaejs<br><br><em>\"We walk around all day in this virtual reality, physically experiencing what the mind is telling us.
