If the soundbox is stuffed full of anything, no music.\"<br>--Rumi (partial)<br><br>----------<br><br>\"I\u2019ll tell you what hermits realize. If you go off into a far, far forest and get very quiet, you\u2019ll come to understand that you\u2019re connected with everything.\u201d<br>--Alan Watts<br>--------------------<br><br>We call it \u201cgetting back to normal\u201d. And oh yeah we want it.<br><br>We\u2019re mighty tired of covid limitations and we want what is called \u201cfreedom\u201d ASAP.<br><br>After all, normal life is busy, active, productive. Normal life is connection with other humans, and social activity, and love.<br><br>Normal is full.<br><br>We adore full. We cannot wait to be full again.<br><br>Which perhaps is why, as covid restrictions lift, people are in a hurry to visit, party, travel, consume. Give us restaurants, bars, airplanes, shopping, festivals and lots and lots of hugs.<br><br>We shall resume where we left off, and \u201cmake up for lost time.\u201d<br><br>As if that\u2019s possible.<br><br>We\u2019re trying though, aiming for extra full \u2013 with extra peopling and extra indulgence. Binging and overeating, over drinking, over spending. Oh yeah.<br><br>We also want to get back to normal life as if nothing had interrupted. As if covid restrictions had never forced us to abandon how things were, with a sudden grinding halt.<br><br>Which is kind of odd. I mean, what\u2019s to gain by trying to pretend this last year-plus never happened? Is it really necessary to undo that year, and as fast as possible?<br><br>It seems so, as the push for normalcy is strong and urgent and everywhere. Everyone knows getting back to former lives feels healthy, right, and necessary.<br><br>And certainly not many are saying, \u201cI liked the downtime, I\u2019m staying alone, isolated and not productive just like this, indefinitely.\u201d<br><br>C\u2019mon, we all know that\u2019s not normal. So stop lazing around and get out there! Do something. Fill \u2018er up.<br><br>Although, it\u2019s not particularly \u201cfree\u201d when it\u2019s a requirement, an obligation, is it.<br><br>But never mind that. Because what we got in Covid-time, and what we\u2019d would rather not ever have again thank you very much, was <em>nothing.<\/em><br><br>Nothingness and lack and deprivation and missing out.<br><br>And far too much empty. Empty time, empty homes, empty streets, empty buildings, empty arms.<br><br>Empty is bad. Empty is unhealthy, lonely, damaged and wrong.<br><br>Humans are not fans of empty.<br><br>Anyone choosing that on purpose is in need of fixing, inquiry and help.<br><br>Full is better. Out is better. Together is better.<br><br>So it's odd that many are finding it uncomfortable to come back out and resume those old lives.<br><br>Lipstick, shoes, pants, small talk, smiling at others, sharing elevators- things can feel strange.<br><br>Partly because during lockdown, newly developed odd quirks, like maybe throwing laundry into drawers unfolded, were unseen.<br><br>And now, back in real life, people will see the wrinkles.<br><br>Oh look, the public face and pretender, the presentation and persona, returns from its year in exile.<br><br>Bringing with it the hider, the secret-keeper, of all those weird behaviors we\u2019ve always sort-of had but allowed more fully while alone in our homes for so long.<br><br>How have we not noticed that socializing comes with more secretiveness, more self consciousness, more comparing?<br><br>\u201cDid I say the wrong thing? Did they like me? Can they tell I am afraid? Can they tell I am weird? Was I awkward? Am I ok? Am I good enough?\u201d<br><br>Returning to normal life means returning to more intense self watching, improving, and evaluating how we're doing.<br><br>Oh good, an evaluation of the self, performed <em>by<\/em> the self. Always a good time.<br><br>Of course it's not as if this self consciousness didn't go on in lockdown too, whether we were with other folks or alone.<br><br>I mean, even in lockdown we harangued ourselves to write that book, learn to cook, take up yoga. If we weren\u2019t going to have a raucous good time with others, we should have at least cleaned a closet.<br><br>It\u2019s just that when we're in others\u2019 company, self judgment intensifies considerably.<br><br>Are we really in such a hurry to resume that? It may not necessarily be as fun as we expect.<br><br>Not to mention that the sense of being empty and not enough can often show up even when we have filled-up on all the normal socializing and eating and drinking.<br><br>So instead of trying so hard to stuff ourselves full of activities and love and enoughnesses,<br><br>which may not get us what we want anyway,<br><br>maybe we could notice that there\u2019s something to be said for aloneness, empty time and checking less frequently on the self\u2019s performance.<br><br>Y\u2019know, those experiences we\u2019ve been so eager to avoid.<br><br>Because in lockdown or not, the human can\u2019t help trying to \u201cmake something\u201d of itself. &nbsp;<br><br>Which is tricky stuff. Because how do you make something out of nothing? &nbsp;<br><br>And are we so sure we are even capable, that it is even possible, that we are the ones whose job it is to \u201cmake something\u201d of time, of life, of existence, of our self?<br><br>The obligation for that kind of making, of producing, is a heavy burden.<br><br>Which is why there may be value in noticing the many advantages of covid empty time, of empty arms, of empty rooms and streets.<br><br>And why that sudden enforced <em>lack<\/em> that we're so sure happened with lockdown may actually have contained an astonishing gift we\u2019re not likely to be blessed with ever again.<br><br>An opportunity that normal, busy public life rarely allows us to receive.<br><br>So maybe we don\u2019t have to run away quite so hard from lockdown and isolation and emptiness and not-normal. &nbsp;<br><br>Maybe we don\u2019t have to try quite so hard to regain what we think we lost.<br><br>Because that resumed normal life just might turn out to be<br><br>the actual<br><br>missing out.<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/a><br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&t=6s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Want to watch Judy's Buddha At The Gas Pump interview? click here<\/a><br><br>-----------------------<br><br><em>\"That beaten track will lead you nowhere.
