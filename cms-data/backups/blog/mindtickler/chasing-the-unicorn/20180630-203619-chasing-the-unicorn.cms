See the goal it creates?<br>","words":720,"content":"Oh dear.<br><br>See that meme above?<br><br>Such an unfair unreasonable illogical crock of... carrot... it is.<br><br>Look at the goal it creates. &nbsp;<br><br>The Better-Me-If-Only goal.<br><br>Look at the dissatisfaction it creates with what you actually are and what you actually have and what you actually experience.<br><br>It\u2019s cruel, really.<br><br>This meme basically tells people who hurt and who feel inadequate and insufficient already (aka pretty much everyone), that there\u2019s a better way to live and a better way to be and they\u2019re not it and they don\u2019t have it.<br><br>Yeah that\u2019s kind.<br><br>And peaceful.<br><br>It\u2019s like dangling a picture of a unicorn and saying \u201cHey unicorns are out there! You\u2019re missing out by not having one. Other, better people have found one and you should take care of this lack in yourself by finding one too!\"<br><br>Pssst\u2026 little secret...<br><br>There are no unicorns.<br><br>Can you see that, even just looked at logically, this mythology is nonsensical?<br><br>I mean really, other than its saying so, is there any direct evidence that the \u201csymptoms\u201d described in the meme are accurate?<br><br>Is this where you say, \u201cWell I know someone who has achieved this! There\u2019s my guru! I myself live exactly this way; this is indeed how it is for me!\u201d<br><br>Gosh I hope not.<br><br>Because let\u2019s just consider for a minute. Think about losing the ability to worry, for example.<br><br>Where would the \u201cability to worry\u201d go, if it got lost? What dark alley?<br><br>Or \u201cfrequent attacks of smiling\u201d and the \u201cunmistakable (hey it\u2019s unmistakable!) ability to enjoy each moment.\u201d<br><br>Um, what?<br><br>Are you aiming to smile through the death of a loved one, physical pain, a lost job, a disinterested spouse?<br><br>Sure let\u2019s aim for a kind of coma-like affect in all situations. &nbsp;That sounds like an admirable goal.<br><br>Surely that\u2019ll be better than\u2026 oh I dunno\u2026 feeling stuff.<br><br>I mean, is only blissed-out non-worried non-conflict acceptable as an experience in life?<br><br>What\u2019s wrong with sadness, anger, fear, humiliation?<br><br>We could as well say only white is an acceptable color and we should somehow \u201cget beyond\u201d red, purple and green. Because those are not enlightened colors.<br><br>So yeah yeah, ok, but this is all really no biggie though, right?<br><br>That meme and what it represents are just some words saying what a lot of people believe, or more likely hope is true.<br><br>Seems harmless enough.<br><br>Except that so many people are encouraged to chase enlightenment by trying to attain something they don\u2019t have.<br><br>Something that may very well be simply non-existent.<br><br>In which case, there\u2019s never going to be any \u2018finding\u2019 that way.<br><br>Which can only lead to increased disappointment and failure.<br><br>Which leads to more searching for enlightenment\u2026<br><br>to get over the disappointment and failure.<br><br>And increased pain and failure is something many people can little afford in their lives.<br><br>So maybe it\u2019s time to try something different.<br><br>Maybe it makes more sense to notice the actual present, what\u2019s actually here, what\u2019s actually experienced.<br><br>As it is.<br><br>Actually.<br><br>And to include everything in that present\u2026judgments, non-smiling, interpretations, worrying and all.<br><br>Maybe we might look to see if the present is so very terrible or so very in need of repair and correction.<br><br>Because while we\u2019re busily focused on finding that awakening and fixing what\u2019s judged to be broken here and now\u2026<br><br>We may not be open to noticing what\u2019s truly already here and now\u2026<br><br>because we\u2019re focused so intently on what isn\u2019t here.<br><br>And really, can we ever know what\u2019s already right in front of us, right here, right now, when we\u2019re scanning the horizon for the unicorn?<br><br>","extra":""}
