This person. This You.","words":759,"content":"\"<em>First,<br>the fish needs to say,<br>\"Something ani't right about this Camel ride-<br>and I'm Feeling so damn<br>Thirsty.\" --Hafiz<br><\/em><br>My friend had a particularly hard time last week. Hurting. Heavy. Isolating. Binging. Hard to get out of bed and function.<br><br>You might have had similar experiences yourself- most people have times like this at some point in their lives, sometimes many points.<br><br>Sometimes many many points.<br><br>So today\u2019s Tickler will not be its usual adorable, tickle-your-mind-so-you-have-fun-finding-all-this-woo-woo-stuff-yourself, self. Instead, today\u2019s Tickler is cutting to this particular chase.<br><br>Which is...<br><br>It\u2019s hard to think you\u2019re a person. This person. This You.<br><br>Think you are a separate individual contained in the body and you\u2019re going to feel incomplete and inadequate. Think you are a separate individual contained in the body and you\u2019re going to have the \u201cinner critic\u201d tell you that you\u2019re not good enough.<br><br>And you will be correct. You feel deficient because you are deficient.<br><br>The individual self is indeed incomplete. Small, limited, flawed, odd, trapped- yes.<br><br>This is the price for being certain of what you are.<br><br>And it's expensive, this near-constant sense of lack. Because there's never enough love, enough success, enough kindness, health, attractiveness, discipline. There's never enough enlightenment. There's always a vague sense of not good enough.<br><br>So naturally you try to fill up that sense of missing something. Busyness and productivity, satsangs and retreats, money, love, addictions.<br><br>And of course none of that does the job.<br><br>Which is additionally painful.<br><br>So hopefully once in a while you ask yourself...<br><br>SO WHAT?<br><br>Because truly, what\u2019s not ok about being insufficient?<br><br>Yes you're not perfect, not good enough, not healthy, not enlightened. So what?<br><br>What about this unwholey state of affairs actually needs to be fixed?<br><br>You might discover that <em>not good enough<\/em> is actually quite good enough.<br><br>There can be enormous relief just in that acceptance.<br><br>However, sometimes the requirement to fix is too strong for acceptance. Sometimes the sense of demanding perfection from your self feels urgent.<br><br>Sometimes the sense of self rejects this separate being, and urgently longs to connect with something better, something bigger.<br><br>Because it only ever wants to get back to the garden.<br><br>At those times, you can start with <em>simply noticing<\/em> the pull to get back to wholeness and perfection again.<br><br>Notice the compulsion.<br><br>Notice the desire to fill up what\u2019s lacking, what\u2019s empty, with<em>&nbsp;something.<\/em><br><br>Because just the act of noticing itself, the observation, can change things. (There\u2019s plenty of science and studies proving that observation affects reality.) ***<br><br>And then, notice the noticing.<br><br>After all, things can\u2019t observe themselves. Things can only be observed from the outside.<br><br>No matter what it \"feels like,\" you are either what notices, or what is being noticed. &nbsp;<br><br>See which is closer to what you really are- the inauthentic, incomplete, loser individual self, or whatever notices it.<br><br>And then see if whatever that is that notices you, watches your self, experiences your self...<br><br>See if that's incomplete. See if that\u2019s inadequate. See if that\u2019s in need of fixing, or a drink, or love, or anything at all.<br><br>Because how much \"more\u201d does <em>everything<\/em> need? It\u2019s already everything.<br><br>Whoa. Look at you.<br><br>You\u2019re enormous. You\u2019re complete. You\u2019re perfect.<br><br>As is.<br><br>You're more than sufficient,<br><br>More than good enough,<br><br>Already.<br><br>Go ahead,<br><br>Try keeping that in bed.<br><br><br>*** https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Observer_effect_(physics)<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled<\/a> every week.<br><br><em>\"We are the dreamers in this dream,<br>The source of the hidden principle is ourselves, and it is fired by our longing to come home.\" --Tony Parsons<\/em><br><br><br><em><br><img align=\"center\" alt=\"\" src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/1577311936713.jpg\" width=\"190\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\"><\/em><br><br>","extra":""}
