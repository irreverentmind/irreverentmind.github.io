LOL. Please.<br><br>No, I was riddled with panic and despair. Because the delightful \u201cinner voice\u201d convinced me that those judges made a mistake, that I didn\u2019t deserve to win, that anywhere I might go dancing afterwards, I\u2019d have to live up to that error, and that I flat-out couldn\u2019t do it.<br><br>It didn\u2019t matter what others thought; their reassurances rolled right off. Nothing dissuaded me from knowing the win was undeserved.<br><br>Under this relentless pressure, I quit dancing for what turned into 18 years.<br><br>Not because I lost. Because I won.<br><br>Thought made sure the win was seen as a loss.<br><br>The mind skews toward the negative.<br><br>That\u2019s its nature.<br><br>Because whatever thought is, in order to (seem to) exist at all, it must have something to think about.<br><br>So it requires problems. It requires,&nbsp;<em>Something\u2019s not right <\/em>projects,&nbsp;and,&nbsp;<em>WHY did this happen<\/em>?&nbsp;riddles, and,&nbsp;<em>How can I fix this?<\/em>&nbsp;solutions and,&nbsp;<em>How can I think my way to safety in an unknown future?<\/em>&nbsp;worries.<br><br>There\u2019s no mental job security in a no-problem present moment.<br><br>So given an&nbsp;opportunity, the mind will ignore every positive and quickly go instead to, \u201cnot good enough,\u201d and, \u201closer, failure, bad, undeserving, unlovable, deficient.\u201d<br><br>With this negative skew, thought defines us.<br><br>Turning every situation, every moment, every context, into a definition, an identity, of an entire&nbsp;not-enough&nbsp;person.<br><br>\"You may have gotten away with a win but you\u2019re really a loser, a fake, not as good as others, and a terrible person.\u201d<br><br>Along with&nbsp;my favorite-&nbsp;<em>Who do you think you are?<\/em><br><br>Always a fun question.<br><br>First, because&nbsp;the thing that\u2019s asking&nbsp;is a gatekeeper with its own agenda.<br><br>So it&nbsp;conveniently leaves&nbsp;out everything that doesn\u2019t serve its problem-generating purpose.<br><br>All that life evidence we trot out to prove our lack and flaws is ferociously slanted and completely biased by the gatekeeper.<br><br>And second, ever wonder<em> why <\/em>the mind cares so dang much about who or what we are? Why&nbsp;it&nbsp;constantly needs to declare, \u201cI am&nbsp;lazy, selfish, guilty, fake, bad, stupid, weak\u201d etc?<br><br>I am&nbsp;I am&nbsp;I am&nbsp;I am\u2026<br><br>Whatever words follow, don\u2019t even matter.<br><br>For now just noticing what we depend on to tell us who we are.<br><br>Because there is no other source to know what we are, other than what thought says.<br><br>None.<br><br>That negative&nbsp;self-serving&nbsp;self-evaluation&nbsp;is the only way we have, to know ourselves.<br><br>In fact, the only way we know we exist at all, is that thought says so.<br><br>Which means we have zero idea who or what we are. Because we have zero&nbsp;access to anything other than the mind\u2019s bias.<br><br>So it\u2019s no surprise that we think there\u2019s something- many things- wrong with us,<br><br>and that we-&nbsp;<em>WE!<\/em>- have to solve them.<br><br>As if it's possible to ever have the mental clarity to solve anything.<br><br>As if it's possible to&nbsp;ever even know if perceived problems are indeed problems.<br><br>So that a should-be-celebrated win can get twisted into failure. And our possible advantages and lovely character traits manage to get dismissed and unloved, if not completely unseen.<br><br>And if right about now, thought is saying, \u201cWell then, what\u2019s the point? Life is meaningless...\u201d<br><br>Notice what it\u2019s really saying is, \u201cYou need me. Without me you\u2019re nothing.\u201d<br><br>Which may be true.<br><br>But what\u2019s so terrible about being nothing? It can\u2019t be worse than being a hopeless failed loser.<br><br>Besides, nothing is nothing. It can\u2019t be turned into something with name calling and I-am-ing.<br><br>Which means, whatever we are, since we don\u2019t know and never will,<br><br>we might as well play with noticing&nbsp;this one tiny moment,<br><br>without evaluation (thought,) correction (thought,) future (thought,) or improvement (thought).<br><br>And then we can see if we need<br><br>Any other dance but<br><br>That.<br><br><img align=\"center\" alt=\"\" src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/1704910467744.jpg\" width=\"254.29\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 17%;\"><br>","extra":"","extra2":""}
