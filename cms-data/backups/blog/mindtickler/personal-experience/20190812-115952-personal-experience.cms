Everything we think is real is based on it.<br><br>Even though by definition, personal experience means, \u201cspecific to Me, with all its unique slants, perspectives, thoughts, and filters.\"<br><br>Y\u2019know, person-al.<br><br>There are the colors and shapes seen in our eyeballs. Sounds heard in our ears. Touch experienced in our fingertips, our skin receptors. There are emotions felt in our bodies, aided and interpreted by thoughts we also call ours.<br><br>Let\u2019s face it, we only know what\u2019s what when it comes through our filters.<br><br>Which means that experience is always specific to us and has nothing to do with Truth.<br><br>And when we presume that it does, we\u2019re basically saying, \u201cMy way is the way. What I experience is all there is.\u201d<br><br>Which is only just a little arrogant.<br><br>Ok, maybe a lot arrogant.<br><br>Because this know-it-all-ness, based strictly on what we see, hear and feel personally, is kind of breathtaking.<br><br>I mean here we are experiencing, and somehow we come to believe that these particular-to-us happenings prove something about the \u201creal world,\u201d that supposedly fact-based and independent real thing.<br><br>Oh we're certain of this. As we are certain that we are capable of perceiving its reality.<br><br>Even though, when we do perceive outside-us things\u2026<br><br>Those perceptions are still our eyes, ears, fingertips, experiencing.<br><br>Personal truth. Not objective truth.<br><br>All while insisting that our reality is the reality.<br><br>Can you say \u201cprojection,\u201d boys and girls?<br><br>And it\u2019s not like this projection is just sometimes, either. No, we\u2019re 100% projecting this Personal Experience, at all times, non-stop.<br><br>So for those who enjoy being important or special- which is pretty much everyone in some way or other- at least this is good news.<br><br>Because it means that we were right- we are the center of the universe; it is all just us projected out into everything. We are necessary.<br><br>Whooo hooo! We knew it!<br><br>Funny enough though, it also turns out to be good news for those who are interested in the idea of Enlightenment and No-Self, too.<br><br>Because when we begin to see that all this Very Important Personal Experience is only a viewpoint, and that all of our, \u201cOf course reality is real!\u201d certainty is just projection\u2026<br><br>Our usually-strong sense of being an individual with a meaningful experience may just begin to go poof.<br><br>Because when we don\u2019t lug around all the limitation that comes with \u201cobjective reality,\u201d the usually-strong sense of self just might feel lighter, filmier, and less concrete.<br><br>Now of course I\u2019m not saying that any of this is ever the least bit necessary. It\u2019s just that many lovely Mind-Tickler readers are curious about this particular personal not-personal experience.<br><br>And as a portal, a way in, the consideration of what is real and what is outside of our biased, filmy, deceptively individual experience, can be very enlightening.<br><br>Even though no amount of considering will ever reveal what is actually outside.<br><br>Because we will never be able to get outside of these perceiving machines.<br><br>So an un-debatable, unalterable Reality that is not tainted or based on personal experience, and is outside of the Me\u2026<br><br>Is something we will never know.<br><br>Because it can't be known. Not by us little humans, anyway.<br><br>Which is fine.
