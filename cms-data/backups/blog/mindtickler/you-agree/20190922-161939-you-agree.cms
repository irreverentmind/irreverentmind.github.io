Because eliminate opinion and we have zero idea who, what, or where we are.<br><br>So naturally we need to know what side we\u2019re on, we need to know our position.<br><br>Though, aren't those interesting words? Because they\u2019re supposedly referring to ideas, but actually they're more literally indicating...<br><br>Geography.<br><br>\u201cThis is where I stand.\u201d<br><br>As if points of view place us.<br><br>Like, \u201cLooking for me? You\u2019ll find me over here, standing on the \u201cI\u2019m for no children in cages\u201d spot.\u201d<br><br>Weird, isn\u2019t it?<br><br>I mean, what are we, bats? &nbsp;Sounding radar-opinions out into the night, using viewpoint as our locator, our GPS?<br><br>\u201cHere I am. I\u2019m the one who is on this political side, who thinks dealing with feelings is best done XYZ way, who likes UG more than Jiddu.\u201d<br><br>Right here. &nbsp;Me. I.<br><br>Located. Through opinion.<br><br>And then, we go looking for matches.<br><br>Because it\u2019s not enough just to know what side we\u2019re on.<br><br>No, it has to be announced. To everyone, everywhere.<br><br>We want people to know. We really want people to know.<br><br>In fact if we can't announce our point of view in any given situation, we say things like, \u201cI can\u2019t be myself around them.\u201d<br><br>Which is not okay with us.<br><br>Enter the slogan T-shirt, the custom license plate, the correction of all those obviously wrong Facebook posts by others. Enter the necessity to slather, \u201cYeah that\u2019s right!\u201d and, \u201cWhat are you smoking!\u201d all over the internet, and at family dinners.<br><br>Our take on everything Must. Be. Known.<br><br>Can you say \u201ccompulsion,\u201d boys and girls?<br><br>Because the drive to state our stance is almost irresistible.<br><br>As if we need that arrow pointing to \u201cus\u201d at all times.<br><br>Could it be the self coalesces around a point of view?<br><br>Of course, such reification and solidity is tenuous. Because after all, the self is a flimsy little thing, needing constant support.<br><br>So we gather agree-ers and like-minded others around us, blocking many if not all disagree-ers.<br><br>As if that We\u2019re-On-The-Same-Side community will give us connection with...<br><br>An unknown whole.<br><br>We think agreement equals that yearned-for connection.<br><br>Never mind that \u201ctaking a side\u201d eliminates wholeness from the get-go.<br><br>Still, the individual constantly yearns for integration... homecoming, almost... with what\u2019s real, truer, bigger than any vaporous concept.<br><br>Because we know that\u2019s what we are.<br><br>And because these ridiculous individuals we are pretending to be do not feel whole.<br><br>Which is how we miss that connection with the whole is already present, and what we crave is already here.<br><br>I mean, vapor mixes with vapor. It\u2019s not held in place by some edge, border or wall of a side or position or stance. It has to merge, because, y'know, vapor.<br><br>Thoughts, concepts, points of view, have to blend together with the us-es and thems.<br><br>Whether we know this or not. &nbsp;Whether we agree or not.<br><br>Now of course there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a point of view, and nothing wrong with shouting it from every rooftop and Facebook timeline.<br><br>After all, we couldn\u2019t stop if we wanted to.<br><br>But it might be interesting to see that agreement, and the gathering of tribes, and the elimination of anyone outside the tribe, will never get us the connection we crave.<br><br>While simply seeing the arbitrary-ness and wispiness of self and point of view, actually might.<br><br>Which could be fun.<br><br>And of course this is just my point of view, just Judy\u2019s position.<br><br>It may be close to your position or not.<br><br>I\u2019ll do my best to be on your team either way.<br><br>Agreed?<br><br><br>Click here to get your <a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mind-Tickled<\/a> every week.<br>","extra":""}
