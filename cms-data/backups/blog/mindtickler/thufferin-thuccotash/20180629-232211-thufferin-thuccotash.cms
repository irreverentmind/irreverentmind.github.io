She tries\u2026 she tries\u2026. Ohhhh, she fails! Again! Judy is a loser again! Score one for everybody but her!\u201d<br><br>There are probably a bunch of these self-descriptions. Just pick one for now. One version of bad imperfect You, whichever seems to fit at the moment.<br><br>Got it? Ok. Now close your eyes, and take a look.<br><br>Picture what that You looks like.<br><br>In your minds eye, summon it up and actually LOOK AT IT.<br><br>What does Bad You look like?<br><br>Is it the Incredible Hulk? Lucy from Peanuts? Zorro? Popeye?<br><br>Maybe it's just body parts- clenched fists, snarling mouth, tears?<br><br>Maybe you see a movie, up on the screen.<br><br>For a lot of people, it\u2019s a cartoon.<br><br>Whatever it is, notice it\u2019s an image. Not an actual thing.<br><br>We all have some image of this Bad-Me thing.<br><br>Anyone who pays attention- which is not most people- can see it.<br><br>There\u2019s an actual representation of the You that\u2019s bad, and the Voice that says so.<br><br>A characterization.<br><br>Interesting word, that \u2026\u201cCharacter-ize.\u201d<br><br>So coming back to our game, look at that image of You, the bad imperfect one.<br><br>Notice you can put your hand through it and wriggle your fingers on the other side.<br><br>That\u2019s how flimsy it is.<br><br>Now notice if that movie or cartoon You has a face.<br><br>Do your best to answer from before I asked, because as soon as it hears the question, mind hastily concocts one.<br><br>Odd are strong that, before I asked, there was no face.<br><br>Mind is almost always too lazy to bother with a drawing up a face.<br><br>Even when it tries to come up with one, it can only dredge up one facial feature at a time. &nbsp;You\u2019ll see eyes but no mouth, or nose but no eyebrows.<br><br>Or else it's hazy, blurry, as if there's Vaseline on the lens.<br><br>Whatever option the face does, notice that this thing that represents You and stands in as the stunt-double You...<br><br>Doesn\u2019t even look like you.<br><br>It\u2019s a faceless blob.<br><br>A cartoon, comic book, drawing or stick figure.<br><br>It's a caricature.<br><br>That's not You.<br><br>That thing can\u2019t make sounds.<br><br>Can\u2019t hurt anything or anyone either.<br><br>In fact, it can\u2019t do\u2026 anything.<br><br>It's just lines, shapes and colors.<br><br>And yet, a good part of what is summoned up as proof of your bad not-good-enough self, is\u2026<br><br>That picture.<br><br>That blob-faced bunch of nothing.<br><br>The one that seems as if it runs the show.<br><br>As if a comic book can make itself real merely by repetition and insistence.<br><br>But.... could it be it\u2019s just not a big deal?<br><br>Because yes that bad inadequate thingy feels like it has some power.<br><br>But no matter what it feels like, bad You still isn\u2019t anything more than an image and a sound.<br><br>Thought says, \u201cI\u2019m bad, obnoxious, crabby, aggressive.\u201d &nbsp;The Lucy image speaks. We believe it.<br><br>Thought says, \u201cI\u2019ll never get there. I\u2019m stuck.\u201d &nbsp;The moving picture has a sound track. We believe it.<br><br>Thought says \u201cNooooo! I don\u2019t want this! This is terrrribblle!\u201d We see a blob in a cage, call it \"resistance\" and add that new label to our already over-full discontent with self.<br><br>And all along, what\u2019s actually speaking?<br><br>An image.<br><br>A no-thing.<br><br>Now I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t listen to the thoughts or the voice.<br><br>Though I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want to; that\u2019s never a happy-making experience.<br><br>I\u2019m just saying maybe you might observe the process.<br><br>Because really, nothing requires anyone to let a cartoon dictate the terms of satisfaction and contentment with life.<br><br>Instead you might notice how much power you pretend these blobs, movies and cartoons have.<br><br>You might notice how crappy that feels.<br><br>And then?<br><br>Who knows?<br><br>Maybe you'll discover you're not obligated to let the Powerpuff Girls or Daffy Duck run your life.<br><br>Maybe you'll discover it's not necessary to let some imagined story of self...<br><br>Some description...<br><br>Some movie...<br><br>Define what you are or aren't.<br><br>Because Pow!
