Let's have some fun.<br><br>Think about that You or Part of You that\u2019s imperfect, not good, not enough.<br><br>Maybe it\u2019s unlovable or a loser or unkind or irresponsible. &nbsp;<br><br>However you might characterize your less-than-ideal self, just pick one for now.<br><br>Now close your eyes, and take a look.<br><br>In your minds eye, summon it up and actually look at it.<br><br>What does Bad You look like?<br><br>OMG, you can actually see it.<br><br>Turns out everyone has some visual of this Bad-Me thing, though sometimes it takes a little practice to notice.<br><br>For many folks, it\u2019s a cartoon- The Incredible Hulk, Lucy from Peanuts, the Tasmanian Devil.<br><br>Or it might be just a body part- a snarling mouth, clenched fists, tears on a cheek.<br><br>Or perhaps it\u2019s an old photograph or movie, seemingly of a real person, such as a parent or spouse.<br><br>Whatever it is, notice it\u2019s an image.<br><br>Certainly not an actual thing, not a real person.<br><br>It's not even an actual photo.<br><br>It\u2019s a mental representation. A stand-in. A characterization.<br><br>Of the You that\u2019s bad. &nbsp;Of the You that\u2019s not enlightened and missing out. Of the You that\u2019s unmotivated, selfish, unloved, a failure.<br><br>You can even put your hand through it and wriggle your fingers on the other side.<br><br>That\u2019s how flimsy it is.<br><br>That's not You.<br><br>That's a wispy bit of mental pixel.<br><br>That thing can\u2019t hurt anyone, or be alone, or make mistakes.<br><br>That thing can\u2019t do anything.<br><br>See, because, it\u2019s not real. &nbsp;It's just lines, shapes and colors, happening in the mind.<br><br>Wherever and whatever the hell that is.<br><br>And yet that picture is a good part of what is summoned up as proof of your bad, not-good-enough self.<br><br>As if a mental cartoon can make itself real, or prove anything, simply by repetition and insistence.<br><br>And then based on said picture, a narrating thought intones, \u201cSee? You're bad, obnoxious, damaged.\u201d &nbsp;<br><br>The moving picture has a sound track. The cartoon comes with a thought-bubble commentary.<br><br>Which naturally you believe.<br><br>Because that's easy to do, when you don\u2019t notice that what\u2019s speaking is a wispy no-thing...<br><br>Commenting about another no-thing.<br><br>And the narrator certainly sounds like it knows what it's talking about.<br><br>Even though there's no proof of that either, except for additional mental movies.<br><br>Now I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t listen to the thoughts or the sound track.<br><br>Though I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want to; that\u2019s never a happy-making experience.<br><br>And I'm not saying try to make the picture go away, though that can be interesting to play with.<br><br>I\u2019m just saying maybe you might observe the process.<br><br>Beginning with how much dissatisfaction and unhappiness with yourself starts with these images of Not-Enough-You.<br><br>Because there is no requirement to let some mental cartoon dictate one\u2019s contentment with life.<br><br>And then?<br><br>Well, maybe you'll have some fun finding out.<br><br>Because really, who doesn't like cartoons or the movies?
