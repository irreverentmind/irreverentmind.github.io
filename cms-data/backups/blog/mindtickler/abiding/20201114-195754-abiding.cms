Or maybe not really sucks, but certainly it's not enough. There\u2019s still reactivity, and lack of expansion, and thoughts on a habitual loop that ensnare us regularly.<br><br>And enlightenment hasn\u2019t shown up yet. Or maybe it has, but it\u2019s left. Or maybe there are still higher levels to be attained, and we haven\u2019t arrived at the end.<br><br>Clearly there\u2019s a there to get to. Which is surely why all those teachers tell of it, and try to explain so we understand, and point to any of the many many methods for getting there.<br><br>Life is a journey; we\u2019re on a path. And paths have an end point, an arrival place.<br><br>Although this one is called the pathless path. So there\u2019s no real path. It isn\u2019t there, not even sort-of. It\u2019s pretend. Otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be called pathless.<br><br>But OK. Wherever it is, we want to get there, And we\u2019re not there, not done, not arrived.<br><br>So this is not it.<br><br>Although some of us are lucky enough to be one of the special ones who do get there.<br><br>It\u2019s done, we did it.

Arrive, get it, keep it, hold it, glue it, chain it, make it stay.<br><br>Forever.<br><br>It's not real unless it stays. \"Just sometimes\" is not enough. It has to abide or it\u2019s inadequate and not the real deal.<br><br>Without abiding, it's just another stop on the ol\u2019 path.<br><br>So seeking a life lived in a never-ending spiritual loop might be full of dissatisfaction, not-enoughness, and even failure.<br><br>Perhaps the opposite of what we\u2019re seeking by all that seeking.<br><br>So instead, The Mind-Tickler wonders... how many lovely readers have tried answering yes to the question, \u201cIs this all there is?\u201d<br><br>Just trying that on.
