Which can then even make you angry or despondent and inclined to say, \u201cScrew this.\u201d<br><br>So what are they talking about? I mean, peace, enlightenment, better feelings, better situations\u2026 &nbsp;let\u2019s face it, none of that seems to be here. Or at least not as much or as frequently as you\u2019ve been told they're supposed to be.<br><br>So naturally you want something else. More enlightenment. More peace. Less suffering. Better everything, please.<br><br>Certainly not this.<br><br>Seeking seems absolutely necessary.<br><br>There\u2019s a ton of obvious wrongness. And it\u2019s not like that\u2019s a breeze to fix. The betterment being sought- &nbsp;awakening, improvement of life, feelings, self and others- &nbsp;well, it\u2019s exhausting and never-ending trying to find it.<br><br>After all, where does \u201cbetter\u201d hang out? Is it sitting on a shelf somewhere, on the chairs in satsang, in some head waiting patiently? Can it be scored by behaving just so, or by embodying, sitting with, solving, inquiring? Maybe all it takes is another political leader, another body at the dining table, more paper in a wallet. Or maybe different sensations in a solar plexus might take care of it all?<br><br>Aw hell. How are you supposed to get some \u201cbetter\u201d if you don\u2019t know where it is?<br><br>Sheesh, what a screw-up existence is. After millennia producing these life forms, shouldn't it have learned the error of its ways and fixed this mess?<br><br>Stupid existence.<br><br>Ok so, that can\u2019t be right, can it? So let\u2019s consider\u2026. maybe we have missed something.<br><br>Let\u2019s imagine for a moment that there\u2019s thick unmovable mud up to our ankles. We look down, see the mud, start figuring out how the mud got there, what caused it, how we feel about it, how to tolerate it, how to make it less immovable, how to make it go away, how to secure the future so there\u2019s never any mud ever again. We envision all the possible consequences that will surely happen if this mud thing isn\u2019t figured out pronto.<br><br>With all that dedicated focus, mud is going to seem like the only thing that matters. I mean who\u2019s going to bother paying attention to where there is no mud- that area from the ankles up- when there\u2019s this serious issue at hand?<br><br>Although isn\u2019t that exactly what we\u2019re seeking with all that solution-finding? A non-mud experience? &nbsp;<br><br>There it is, above the ankles.<br><br>And now, substitute the word \u201cpain\u201d for \u201cmud\u201d and it gets clearer that when one focuses on pain, non-pain (non-mud) is ignored. So life feels like constant unrelenting suffering. It feels impossible to notice the vast amount of self and life and experience which is not hurting and fine, when pain is all that is seen.<br><br>Even though tons of non-pain is happening.<br><br>So the sages may have been right.<br><br>Because whether we're seeking enlightenment or consciousness or the end of suffering, sadness, or anger\u2026<br><br>It could be that the, \u201cYou already are what you seek\u201d stuff is just a matter of attention. Attention to the above-the-ankles-totally-fine experience that\u2019s already here, instead of only to below-the-ankles wrongness.<br><br>Because if we are able to know what we feel, then consciousness is already present and awake to us (whatever \u2018us\u2019 is) and therefore doesn\u2019t need to be sought. If we are able to seek peace, then peace must be already present in order to provide the room to do that seeking, and therefore doesn\u2019t need to be sought. If we are able to seek consciousness, then consciousness must already be present in order to do that seeking, and therefore doesn\u2019t need to be sought.<br><br>No need to seek what\u2019s here already.<br><br>Y\u2019know, because\u2026 here. Already.<br><br>This is great news. After all, it\u2019s a whole lot less work to notice the non-mud, non-pain that\u2019s already here than it is to figure out how to create a non-mud existence from scratch.<br><br>Like we were god or existence or something.<br><br>Now, this is not suggesting to not feel pain, or to ignore pain, or to \u201csit with\u201d pain. This is an invitation to consider the possibility that\u2026<br><br>We are capable of noticing the \u201cpart\u201d of us that is ok whether pain is here or not.<br><br>We are capable of noticing that even when we hurt, we are also ok, also awake, also conscious and consciousness.<br><br>Even when we think we\u2019re not.<br><br>We are the human having an experience, the awareness of the experience, AND the experience itself.<br><br>Which means there\u2019s nothing to seek. That which we\u2019ve been seeking- we are all of it. Always have been.<br><br>We just didn\u2019t realize.<br><br>And of course, seeking is as good an experience as any other too.<br><br>Which leaves us with nowhere else to go, nothing else to chase.<br><br>Nothing to seek.<br><br>Not even the end of seeking.<br><br>","extra":""}
