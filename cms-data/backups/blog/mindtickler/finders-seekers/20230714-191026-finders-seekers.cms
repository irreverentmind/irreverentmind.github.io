He says he lost his keys. They both look under the streetlight together. After a few minutes the cop asks if the man if he is sure he lost them here, and the drunk replies, \u201cNo, I lost them in the park.\u201d The policeman asks, \u201cSo why are you searching here?\u201d And the drunk replies, \"Because this is where the light is.\u201d<br>--&nbsp;Nasreddin<br><br>----------<br>\u201cStreetlight effect: when people only search for something where it is easiest to look.\u201d<br>--Wikipedia<\/em><br><br>----------<br><br>You been told you shouldn\u2019t, it\u2019s not the thing to do, it isn\u2019t helpful, doesn\u2019t work.
