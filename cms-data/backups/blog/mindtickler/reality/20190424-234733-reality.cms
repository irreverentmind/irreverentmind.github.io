In the real, the question \u2018what is real?\u2019 does not arise.\" --Nisargadatta<\/em><br><br><br>Reality.<br><br>We all know what it is. We all know it when we see it.<br><br>Duh. Not much question there.<br><br>But even if weirdly, incomprehensibly, we somehow <em>didn't<\/em> know what\u2019s real, all we\u2019d have to do is look around and see where large numbers of other people agree. That would prove it for sure.<br><br>Or at least appear to.<br><br>Maybe reality is a numbers game.<br><br>Although... lots of folks say they see the sky. Do those numbers mean the sky is actually a real thing?<br><br>Besides, people who don\u2019t agree with us <em>also<\/em> think they\u2019ve got reality on their side. You only have to look at politics to see this in action. Or on Facebook, in any Enlightenment group.<br><br>So what\u2019s the deal? I mean, things are real or they aren\u2019t, no? Shouldn't this be un-debatable?<br><br>Well, maybe we could sort this out by noticing what we depend on to know what\u2019s real.<br><br>Well, there\u2019s <em>our&nbsp;<\/em>feelings. <em>Our<\/em> thoughts. Sensation in <em>ou<\/em>r fingers. Colors and shapes in <em>our<\/em> eyes. Sounds happening in <em>our<\/em> ears.<br><br>Noticing a pattern?<br><br>They're all ways to describe the true favorite for knowing what's real: Personal Experience.<br><br>Y'know, that never-biased, never wildly-skewed, always totally trustable source we can unfailingly depend on for truth.<br><br>Meanwhile, what\u2019s the actual common denominator?<br><br>Us.<br><br>There's no way to find reality unless it passes through the Me fulcrum. Without the Me, it\u2019s\u2026 nothing.<br><br>Uh oh.<br><br>Turns out Reality is not static, not set in stone. It's actually very variable, very person-al.<br><br>Turns out there\u2019s no way to know <em>anything<\/em> outside one\u2019s own senses and experience, which are limited, narrow, biased, and have absolutely no idea about \"reality.\"<br><br>That makes everything ME-ality, not reality. &nbsp;<br><br>It's not \u201cthings as they actually exist,\u201d as Merriam-Webster defines it, but instead, \u201cthings as the ME experiences them\u201d.<br><br>Which are not even close to being the same thing.<br><br>Now, this might seem alarming to those who like to have some certainty.<br><br>Because let\u2019s face it, without a sure sense of what\u2019s real, how can we tell what anything is? How can we know right, wrong, good, bad? How can we know the difference between what\u2019s true vs a made-up cockamamie point of view?<br><br>Well, exactly.<br><br>We can't.<br><br>Which is why those questions have driven mankind crazy for thousands of years.<br><br>There\u2019s simply no peace there.<br><br>So instead, maybe we can notice the amazingness of seeing that there\u2019s nothing real without little ol\u2019 us.<br><br>Existence, perception, reality, experience\u2026<br><br>They are all us.<br><br>Experience depends on us.<br><br>Talk about powerful. Talk about important. Talk about special.<br><br>And once the mind gets over the idea that there is no solid and magical reality-land where everything is real and solid and certain and right\u2026<br><br>There can be an immediate shift, if one is open to it.<br><br>Things can get more diffuse. Less centered, less locatable.<br><br>Ironically, the Me becomes less important, not more.<br><br>Ironically, when it\u2019s seen that there is nothing outside of the Me experience, the sense of Me begins to dissipate.<br><br>And as it happens, that very realization is what so many lovely Mind-Tickler readers have been seeking for a very long time.<br><br>There it is.<br><br>Right there, in our own fingertips.<br><br>Right there- our own world. Our own viewpoint. Our own rules.<br><br>I mean\u2026<br><br>Who needs more reality than that?<br><br><br><em>\"People who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do.\" &nbsp;<br>--Isaac Asimov<\/em><br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/a><br><br>","extra":""}
