Are those carrots? I\u2019m wasting my life. They don\u2019t like me. Oh what a pretty flower! I need to do something. I don\u2019t get it. I want to get it. I\u2019ll never get it. There\u2019s not enough money. I\u2019m bad. My shoelace is untied. I\u2019m alone unloved and abandoned. I don\u2019t like this. I do like this. Like, like, like. Don\u2019t like, don\u2019t like, don\u2019t like. I\u2019ll never be good enough. I\u2019m too old. Where\u2019s the cat?<br><br>Thought. It\u2019s what\u2019s for dinner. Always something to chew on. Always another helping coming right up.<br><br>In fact there\u2019s so much that it feels as if we get lost in thought, or caught in thought. Like it\u2019s some kind of magical thicket or forest or maze or something.<br><br>Although if we pay attention we can see that there\u2019s nothing there, no maze, nothing to keep us trapped inside anything. Just some words, some sounds. It could as easily be, \u201cArooth mekinnel pariseem\u201d as, \u201cI\u2019m not good enough.\u201d<br><br>Sounds, letters, shapes. That\u2019s about it.<br><br>\u2018Course, we attribute meaning to some sounds.<br><br>Which thought just loves. Because meaning is where pain lives.<br><br>\u201cAlumm halleee fersid?\u201d Nothing. \u201cKrulleee?\u201d Nope. \u201cI\u2019ll die alone and unloved?\u201d Now we\u2019re talking. Now we\u2019ve got something to hold on to. Because those words mean we are doomed, not enough as is, inadequate.<br><br>Those words mean we are.<br><br>\u201cBlah blah kurleee blah flower blah failure blah enough blah dinner blah misgilibee.\u201d \u201cBlah\u201d is not painful, \u201cmisgilibee\u201d is not painful, \u201cflower\u201d is not painful. \u201cFailure\u201d is. Because it's meaning about Me. That comes with pain, which solidly locks the sense of self into feeling real.<br><br>No meaning, no pain. No pain, no importance. No importance, no trap. And no problem.<br><br>Put another way, where there\u2019s pain, there\u2019s self.<br><br>Which is why it can seem so important to focus on the thoughts that seem to generate difficult feelings. &nbsp;We spend so much time figuring out which hurt and what they mean and whether we agree with them or like them or believe them or whether they\u2019re true. We\u2019re devoted to stopping thoughts, changing them, having more positive ones, and not letting them get the better of us.<br><br>Busy busy busy. &nbsp;Thinking thinking thinking.<br><br>The self is identified with all that activity.<br><br>So perhaps we could consider instead, just for a moment, whether it actually even matters what we think, what thoughts are about, or whether we believe them.<br><br>Because it could just be we haven't noticed that, \u201cOh look, a penny!\u201d is exactly the same in power and importance as, \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with me.\u201d<br><br>And even though for some Mind-Tickler readers this is a scandalous idea, still it might be that what thoughts are about is not what it\u2019s about.<br><br>Because without all the focus and attention we dedicatedly give them, thoughts are just radio playing in the background. &nbsp;Background sound doesn\u2019t have to be changed or fixed. It can just play on. No biggie.<br><br>And the feeling that\u2019s left when thought plays its meandering blah blah songs without scrutiny, analysis, focus, or attention\u2026 well, it\u2019s pretty sweet. In fact it\u2019s the opposite of painful, for a change.<br><br>Somehow all that very important problematic stuff suddenly isn\u2019t a problem.<br><br>Same life, same Me, same thoughts. Just the \u201cSo what?\u201d is new.<br><br>We may find that one thought is as good and as equal as the next. And the next. And the next. And the next. And the next. And that nothing has to be done about any of it.<br><br>Which might make that whole maze thing a whole bunch of nothing.<br><br>Now there's something to chew on and eat through for dinner.<br>","extra":""}
