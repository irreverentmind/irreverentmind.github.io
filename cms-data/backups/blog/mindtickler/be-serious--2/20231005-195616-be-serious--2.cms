I\u2019m not goal-oriented enough, not suffering enough, not serious enough, and not working hard enough to fix all that.<br><br>\"With you, it is only 'laugh until you die,'\u201d they said.<br><br>Well gosh, yes, that does sound terrible.<br><br>More effort, less laughter. Got it.<br><br>For many fundamentalists, there\u2019s no wisdom or value in humor.<br><br>There\u2019s no room for lightness in enlightenment.<br><br>But, see\u2026 the word itself contains\u2026 Ok never mind.<br><br><em>\u201cThe enlightened fool sees the ego trips of society and still finds joy and laughter in its midst. The fool is often the one with crazy wisdom. With laughter and jokes as their weapon, the fool possesses a wisdom that is out of reach of the conformist.\" &nbsp;--George Carlin<\/em><br><br>In this same online conversation (aka lecture), I was given the (unrequested)advice to start looking for, \u201cI am.\u201d<br><br>While being informed that, \u201cI am\u201d is always here.<br><br>Soooooo, why would I look for it? It\u2019s here already.<br><br>Maybe I have to look for it in order for I am to be here?<br><br>Ok, I'll start looking for both seriousness and I am, soon as I'm done looking for the sense in these comments.<br><br>I mean, have these important people never heard of the cosmic joke?<br><br>Y\u2019know, joke. As in, funny.<br><br><em>\u201cLife as it is should be enough of a reason to laugh. It is so absurd, it is so ridiculous. It is so beautiful. It is a cosmic joke.\u201d --Osho<br><\/em><br>The cosmic joke is: we are what we are seeking.<br><br>Already. Seek it or not.<br><br>So I mean sure, I can keep looking for what I\u2019ve already got.<br><br>But\u2026 Well OK yeah, that is pretty funny.<br><br><em>\u201cI laugh when I think how I once sought paradise as a realm outside of the world of birth. It is the laughter of one who, after having painfully searched for something for a long time, finds it one morning in the pocket of his coat.\" --Thich Nhat Hanh<\/em><br><br>All these wise-guys taking their selves and their approaches and methods ever so earnestly, determinedly, unsmilingly. &nbsp;<br><br>And apparently they\u2019re taking mine and everyone else's the same way too. Because their own heaviness is not enough- they want us to catch it also.<br><br>And yet, what exactly is it that needs to be \u201ctaken\u201d seriously?<br><br>It\u2019s not the self- we don\u2019t even know what that is. Fiction doesn\u2019t care how it\u2019s \u201ctaken.\u201d<br><br>Is it I am? Does I am insist on weighty solemnity?<br><br>What for?<br><br>But if so it needs to lighten up. Because let\u2019s face it, these selves are ridiculous.<br><br><em>\u201cEnlightenment is so light\u2013 just like laughter. The theologians have made it so heavy, so burdensome, that people ignore it.\u201d &nbsp;--Osho<\/em><br><br>Besides, what isn\u2019t funny about this spiritual stuff?<br><br>Nothing, that\u2019s what.<br><br><em>\u201cLila, (Sanskrit: \u201cplay\" ) in Hinduism: the effortless or playful relation between the Absolute, or brahman, and the contingent world.\u201d --wikipedia<\/em><br><br>Meanwhile, all those online lecturing non-dual finger-waggers- I really do feel for them.<br><br>Really, I do.<br><br>Not enough to engage them in conversation, of course.<br><br>But still, it seems like a hard way to spend this one precious life (apologies, Mary Oliver)- to be constantly seeking what\u2019s already here, trying to become what one already is.<br><br>All that striving. For something they\u2019ve already got.<br><br>And meanwhile, so many so-called awake people just spontaneously combust anyway, unasked-for, without a lick of effort. &nbsp;How does that fit into the fundamentalist model?<br><br>Now to be clear, I am not saying only laugh it up and ignore any pain or seriousness. &nbsp;<br><br>But to avoid lightness because it messes up some made-up rule of attainment is absurd, and not in a funny way.<br><br>Because humor disarms the mind and eases its resistance in ways the direct assault of effort and method often cannot do.<br><br>So for many folks, it could be that the serious, goal-oriented substance of what this self achieves and personally makes happen, is actually in the way.<br><br>Maybe we need more not-important, more trivial, more merry whimsical shallowness.
