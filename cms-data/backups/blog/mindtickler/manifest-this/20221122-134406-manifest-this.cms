Well, ok yeah, more like terrified.<br><br>Because for years she\u2019s been convinced she won\u2019t have enough money later in life.<br><br>She envisions retiring with nothing, just the shopping cart and mattress under the bridge, or the dank dingy one room apartment.<br><br>I mean, she\u2019s getting by ok now.<br><br>But there\u2019s no comfort in that, because she\u2019s focused on a very deficient&nbsp;later, and flooding her current life with an abundance of fear.<br><br>Which is why she\u2019s trying very intently to manifest future money. Visualizing incoming checks, big bank balances, pension with plenty of commas. Reciting positive affirmations to cheer herself on.<br><br>Trying to make her thoughts align with a positive vibration and create an abundance mindset.<br><br>Whatever any of that even is.<br><br>Now of course this person is not alone in her efforts and beliefs. Manifesting is a very popular idea.&nbsp;Many many folks, maybe even you too, believe that if we just think right, we can have everything we want.<br><br>And that every like and preference can, and&nbsp;should,&nbsp;be manifested.<br><br>By, y\u2019know, us.<br><br>And of course&nbsp;it\u2019s easy to see the great appeal of that kind of personal human power.<br><br>After all, the self loves to pretend all happenings in the universe revolve around it.<br><br>It\u2019s just that maybe we're a little confused.<br><br>First, because how can anyone get an abundance mindset by starting from a mindset of, \u201cnot enough?\u201d<br><br>Which is where all manifesting starts from. Lack and not-enough is what creates the need for manifesting in the first place.<br><br>Yet abundance means more than enough. Needing more is the opposite of that.<br><br>And if there\u2019s more than enough, then there\u2019s already abundance. So why would anyone ever need to manifest?<br><br>The whole premise makes no sense.<br><br>Not to mention, what\u2019s listening? What\u2019s interested in noticing humans\u2019 properly-worded requests, and based on them, meting out rewards and occasionally granting plenty of money and love and other enoughnesses?<br><br>Energy? The Universe? God? Life? Existence?<br><br>Whatever any of those things are, are we saying it's helpless in the face of the magnetizing power of human thoughts? Are we saying that what it wants doesn\u2019t matter? Are we saying that the universe or God doesn\u2019t already have things just the way it likes?<br><br>Does the universe needs humans to visualize properly so it knows what to do next?<br><br>Does existence hear our properly manifested thought and say, \u201cOh yes that\u2019s right, I forgot about giving Judy her millions of dollars. I can\u2019t resist the attraction of her abundance mentality. Silly me, let me correct that error right now.\u201d<br><br>Apparently we believe that if life or the universe has a different preference than ours, it's in error.<br><br>And in that case, our preference should take priority.<br><br>I mean here\u2019s the universe, energy, existence, doing its thing, minding its business as it has done for over 3 billion years,<br><br>and then, in the last 300,000 years, along come humans with the idea that more money or more love or less suffering would make things better.<br><br>And we-&nbsp;mighty puppet masters all-&nbsp;think the universe says, \u201cOops! My bad.\u201d<br><br>Um, what?<br><br>Besides, how have we not noticed that trying to control the attractions of the universe brings lots what we&nbsp;don\u2019t&nbsp;want - unease, worry, deprivation, guilt, sadness, anxiety.<br><br>Ugh.<br><br>So if abundance is what is needed, why not start with noticing how abundant life is, already?<br><br>Because how can more come to anyone who disregards the incredible richness of what has already shown up?<br><br>It could just be that, with a focus on what\u2019s here instead of what isn\u2019t, we might discover that despite what we think,<br><br>there is no lack.<br><br>No need for more.<br><br>No&nbsp;need for more money, safety, love, peace, enlightenment.<br><br>We might discover the huge relief of already-here abundance.<br><br>We might discover the huge relief of not being responsible, or at fault, for what existence is already providing.<br><br>We might discover a trust, a surrender, a peace in the enormity of what&nbsp;is&nbsp;here.<br><br>Which just might turn out to be more abundance<br><br>than we will ever know<br><br>what to do with.<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/a><br><br><br><em>\"If you take your hands off the tiller, the boat will steer itself and do a vastly better job of it than you ever would.
