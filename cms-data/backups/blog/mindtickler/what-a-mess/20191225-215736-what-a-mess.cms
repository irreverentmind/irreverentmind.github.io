Dishes sit in sinks, unfolded laundry piles up, dust settles on tabletops.<br><br>Also apparently lacking is the motivation to correct this grievous behavior.<br><br>So things are out of place all over the place. <em>(funny, because is \u201cout of place\u201d even possible?)<\/em><br><br>Still, it is amazing how many folks are stressed out, guilty and shamed by the inability to keep a clean house.<br><br>Perhaps because everyone knows that a sloppy home \u201creflects\u201d something about <em>us<\/em>. Unkempt home reflects unkempt self. Messy home reflects messy mind.<br><br>As usual, it's about us.<br><br>That rat's nest we call a home is no exception.<br><br>Untidy means we're bad, lazy, doing things wrong.<br><br>Never-mind that if we <em>did<\/em> clean, dust would settle right back on those counters the instant we stopped wiping them.<br><br>Because dust is the boss of dust.<br><br>Not us.<br><br>While we\u2019re busily saying, \u201cDisarray is wrong,\u201d nature laughs.<br><br>Because nature adores a good mess. In fact nature <em>endorses <\/em>mess.<br><br>I mean, have you looked outside lately? There\u2019s dirt out there!<br><br>There is zero evidence that existence wants our homes clean.<br><br>So this human problem may be less about whether things are tidy,<br><br>And more about the attempt to impose our will and order and control on everything including environment.<br><br>We want to be the boss of all things and situations, including the mind, and then we want the power to make ourselves make all this happen.<br><br>Which is why we either spend vast amounts of our limited time here on this planet cleaning what nature immediately makes messy again\u2026<br><br>Or we fail. Like the incompetent gods we are.<br><br>You can see why we hate chaos.<br><br>And why we find tidiness calming. Because all is right with the world when disorder is controlled and put in neat rows.<br><br>By <em>us.<\/em><br><br>So yes, some folks run around stuffing things in closets and vacuuming and de-piling before company comes.<br><br>Hoping for a taste of ordered calm, and hoping that chaos won\u2019t expose them for the insignificant, easily-wiped-out, powerless flecks of dust they really are.<br><br>Now of course there\u2019s nothing wrong with any of this. I mean, if there\u2019s calm in a spotless home, then why not clean it.<br><br>It\u2019s just that by trying to impose order, we really are fighting<em> what is.<\/em><br><br>It's a never-ending job, always requiring more. <em>(Though somehow when it comes to enlightenment, we expect one and done.

But I (sort of) digress.)<\/em><br><br>Meanwhile, there could actually be more calm to be found in the willingness to let disorder be what it is, instead of continually fighting a losing battle.<br><br>And instead of imposing some weird human notions of rightness, power and fastidiousness.<br><br>Though I realize that the yelling, internal parental voice may not allow such willingness or acceptance.<br><br>Still, as always, <em>this is it.<\/em> &nbsp;And<em> it<\/em>- existence- consistently includes dirt and disarray.<br><br>Besides, noticed or not, order is already here. It just happens to include pet hair and scattered piles and disorganization.<br><br>So fighting grunginess less, and letting mess have us more, might bring a truer calm and a truthier truth.<br><br>Though either is as good a way to spend our life times as any.<br><br>We can\u2019t get this wrong.<br><br>Which is pretty darn<br><br>Neat<br><br>When we think about it.<br><br>And no scrubbing required.<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled <\/a>every week.<br><br><em>\"Chaos is always losing, but never defeated.\" --Alan Watts<\/em><br><br><br><img align=\"center\" alt=\"\" src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/1577310855311.jpg\" width=\"151\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\"><br><br>","extra":""}
