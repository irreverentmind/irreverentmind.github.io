It\u2019s got to go. I need to be rid of it.\u201d<br><br>I hear this often.<br><br>What is this terrible, evil, life-can\u2019t-be-right-till-it\u2019s-gone thingy?\u2019<br><br>Thought. Mind. Ego. Personality. Different words, same same.<br><br>Whatever it\u2019s called, it needs to get G. O. N. E.<br><br>Good spiritual seekers know that thoughts need to be slowed down so there\u2019s more space in between. Better yet, disappear those suckers completely. Mind-stillness is better. Silence is better. And let\u2019s face it- the internal voice is a tyrant. Who wouldn\u2019t want that crab to shut up?<br><br>Clearly, thought-eradication is necessary for enlightened, self-less, clear, transcendence.<br><br>And of course guess who it\u2019s up to, to make all that happen?<br><br>Enter helplessness, shame, guilt, secrecy and resignation.<br><br>Great, give us some more o\u2019 that!<br><br>Although \u2026<br><br>Good luck having a wonderful happy life <em>without<\/em> mind.<br><br>First, because if it did leave, where would it go- the isle of exiled minds?<br><br>And second, because what would we be left with, without thought?<br><br>Can you say \u201ccoma?\u201d<br><br>Maybe just some kind of sausage with feet.<br><br>Could it be we <em>need<\/em> this mind we are so sure stands between us and enlightenment and a better life?<br><br>Not to mention, when we are perpetually looking for ways to make thought leave, we are perpetually having to \u2026<br><br>keep seeking.<br><br>Because thoughts keep coming. Ego doesn\u2019t vanish (A quick glimpse of all the enlightened sages on Facebook will verify this.)<br><br>Mind drives the car, helps with homework, plans the workweek.<br><br>Trying to make it disappear is a never-ending exercise in failure.<br><br>While on the other hand, if we suddenly saw that perhaps mind <em>doesn't<\/em> have to die, that we\u2019re fine even with thought\/self\/personality still seemingly \u201chere\u201d \u2026<br><br>There would be nothing more to chase.<br><br>Surprise!<br><br>What we\u2019ve been seeking all this time actually might require the opposite of trying to eradicate mind.<br><br>Besides, is mind even kill-able at all? Is that truly a possibility?<br><br>That implies that it\u2019s a real thing.<br><br>When actually, it\u2019s a concept. So is the idea that mind\/thought\/ego exists at all.<br><br>We\u2019ve been hell-bent on getting rid of an idea.<br><br>And ideas are... well, what, exactly?<br><br>Not to mention, <em>what<\/em> wants the mind gone?<br><br>That would be\u2026<br><br>Itself.<br><br>Ok so let\u2019s get this straight.

It's just exhausting.<br><br>So what if instead, we could let the ideas just have their little games? Let them run free, like happy ponies in a field.<br><br>After all, they\u2019re ideas.
