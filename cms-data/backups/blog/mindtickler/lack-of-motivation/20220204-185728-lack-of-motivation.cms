But the vastness has never waited for the mind to recognize that there is no doer for doing to occur.\"<br>--Suzanne Segal<\/em><br><br><br>I work with a lot of people who struggle to get motivated.<br><br>Apparently there\u2019s a whole lot of stuff not getting done out there.<br><br>There are taxes overdue, books not written, new businesses not launching. There\u2019s de-cluttering not happening, exercise not happening, homework not done.<br><br>Leaving the house for chores is a big deal for some. And forget about phone calls- so much stalling instead of calling. &nbsp;<br><br>Pretty much everyone stalls about something.<br><br>We call this \"Lack of Motivation.\"<br><br>As if it's missing. And as if motivation can be had, scored, grabbed, in quantity.<br><br>At will. Our will.<br><br>Like getting fistfuls of Halloween candy. We just have to reach out and grab.<br><br>Because we're supposed to earn the candy. We're supposed to do the hard work before we\u2019re entitled to the rewards. We\u2019re supposed to deserve good stuff.<br><br>And we don\u2019t. We just sit there, undeserving.<br><br>If only we were more like other people and did things ahead of schedule and worked harder. Then we'd be entitled to reap our rewards.<br><br>So we push. Comparing, harassing, and hating on ourselves with visions of crappy consequences and wasted opportunities.<br><br>Turning to self-help books, hypnosis, affirmations and organizing plans and structure for accomplishing.<br><br>Trying \u2013 unsuccessfully- to force ourselves to Do.<br><br>Which all starts to mean something about who we are as a person.<br><br>Lazy. Useless. Dirty. A waste of space and life. Not a contributing member of society. Not living up to potential. Broken, wrong, bad.<br><br>Sitting on the couch defines us.<br><br>And it\u2019s not a definition we like.<br><br>The thing is though, if we think about it, there's lots we want to do, lots we intend to do, lots we know would feel better once it got done.<br><br>We yearn to accomplish. We want to make things happen. We\u2019re eager to get going.<br><br>Isn't that motivation?<br><br>Huh.<br><br>Motivation isn\u2019t actually lacking. We\u2019ve got plenty of it.<br><br>Yet we\u2019re sitting on the couch anyway.<br><br>Maybe motivation is not what instigates action. Maybe motivation is actually unable to force anyone to get up and at 'em.<br><br>In fact, for some, poke too much and there\u2019s more, not less, inclination to stay actionless. Just out of spite or fear.<br><br>How is it possible we haven't noticed that all the mean berating of ourselves, all the attempted inspiring with visions of an awful consequences, actually isn\u2019t motivating at all?<br><br>Turns out, constant finger-stabbing produces the opposite of what we\u2019re aiming for.<br><br>Turns out we don\u2019t have a clue how to control our behavior and productivity.<br><br>Turns out we struggle for control because we don\u2019t have any.<br><br>Doing is a happening that\u2019s out of our hands.<br><br>Which of course seems outrageous to the inner voice that says, \u201cWell I have to be in control! Otherwise Nothing Will Get Done!\u201d<br><br>But it\u2019s already not getting done. Even with the inner yelling at us.<br><br>That voice simply hasn\u2019t noticed that it has no power. And that it simply has no clue what to do.<br><br>We\u2019re not in charge of this. &nbsp;<br><br>No amount of motivation can give control we don\u2019t have.<br><br>So what would it feel like if we could see that we\u2019re a passenger, not the driver?<br><br>And that non-doing is not our doing?<br><br>What if none of this is our fault (despite what has been learned and ingrained?)<br><br>Well then, maybe then we can give ourselves a break.<br><br>Even if that seems opposite to what\u2019s called for.<br><br>Because let\u2019s face it, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s called for. We don\u2019t know how to make ourselves the boss of motivation and action.<br><br>Luckily though, and perhaps shockingly, relaxing a responsibility we don\u2019t really have anyway, can relax fear of lack and failure.<br><br>Which can relax constraints on action.<br><br>Getting ourselves out of the way just might allow action to be taken.<br><br>Things might just begin to get done. &nbsp;<br><br>Without us.<br><br>Allowing a Doer that does know how to get things done,<br><br>to do its job, unharassed.<br><br>What a relief.<br><br>And it could just be that<br><br>we deserve that gift.<br><br>Just for being alive.<br><br><br><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/a><\/strong><br><br><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&t=6s\">Click here to watch Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump<\/a><\/strong><br><br><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7RTsMwHqu3Q\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click to watch Judy and Walter have fun chatting <\/a><\/strong>about about<br>nonduality, the self, consciousness, awareness, free will<br>and other light and breezy stuff<br><br><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BAa3UCEyROQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Judy And Robert Saltzman talk nonduality<\/a><\/strong><br>and again: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7fv_vsvaejs<br>and again: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3DAn8Rqg3I0<br><br><br><em>\"Who grows the oranges in the orange tree?
