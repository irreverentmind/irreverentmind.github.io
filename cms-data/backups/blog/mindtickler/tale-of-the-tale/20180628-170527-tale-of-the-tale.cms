We love 'em. Humans narrate life. All the time.","words":563,"content":"Stories. We love \u2018em.<br><br>We like them big. Big feelings, big transformations, big come-uppances. &nbsp;Larger than life? (interesting expression.) Yes please.<br><br>Love! Pain! Royals! Trump!<br><br>Drama is greatly preferred but boring will do if necessary. It\u2019s not required to like the story, or even to be entertained. Subject matter? Irrelevant. We\u2019ll tell a tale about anything. (\u201cThe water is grey today.\u201d) &nbsp;<br><br>Humans narrate life.<br><br>Watching, symbolizing, evaluating, chronicling.<br><br>All. The. Time.<br><br>\u201cI am feeling anxious. She shouldn\u2019t have said that. He was angry and depressed. I need more money. The umbrella is gone. This pain is terrible- it\u2019s like an elephant inside. I\u2019m in love. The sky is blue.\u201d<br><br>These are descriptions of experience, a constant masking narration, putting up a separating layer between us and existence.<br><br>Turns out we are much less interested in living than in describing living.<br><br>No other creatures do this. Other species just are. Is-ness happening.<br><br>Which, funny enough, is an unembellished presence that many enlightenment seekers happen to aspire to.<br><br>So then why not drop the requisite telling of how we feel, who we are, what we think, and if we\u2019re getting anywhere?<br><br>Nah, most humans are going to hold tight to narration as if our lives depended on it.<br><br>Which, maybe they do.<br><br>After all, what exactly would be left if it was possible for the constant story-telling to fall away?<br><br>There\u2019s be no tale of Me, no experiencer, no evaluation of like-not-like, or good-bad, right-wrong, or \u201cwho I am.\u201d There\u2019s be no identity, meaning, or symbols. There's be no analysis, talking about, thinking about.<br><br>Yeah, no thanks.<br><br>Give us TV, movies, computer, Facebook, let us delve compulsively into people\u2019s lives including our own, let us try to fix things via inquiry, therapy, and medication. Hey maybe we\u2019ll find enlightenment via talking ourselves through meditation, thank you very much.<br><br>Being without the narrative sounds sooo unappealing.<br><br>Because there can\u2019t be a sense of Self without story. &nbsp;<br><br>Even the word \u201cmyself\u201d is description.<br><br>There can\u2019t be a way to know where experience ends and Me begins, unless there is constant metaphoring.<br><br>Description creates fantasy while masquerading as reality, provides certainty and a sense of Me-ness that separates absolutely everything.<br><br>And it feels like an absolute given.<br><br>Most folks are not likely to give that up.<br><br>Even though without story, it\u2019s a helluva lot quieter.<br><br>A whole bunch of crazy goes instantly poof. Including the sense of Self.<br><br>Still\u2026 probably not.<br><br>Which is fine of course.<br><br>Even so, every once in a while\u2026<br><br>Maybe experiencing without chronicling will happen anyway.<br><br>Maybe the ABOUT overlay will occasionally be noticed. Maybe the storied presence that so many people work so hard for will be noticed to be here already.<br><br>Maybe once in a while\u2026<br><br>Who knows. Who can know. Who will report.<br><br>Is-ness.<br><br>Happily ever after.<br><br>The end.<br><br>","extra":""}
