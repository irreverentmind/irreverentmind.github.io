I mean, only a few disbelievers are going to rush out to get their faces within inches of other folks, sweating and breathing heavy all over them, in enclosed places for hours, just for fun. (Last fall, a couple hundred rebels did just that, many got sick, and 12 died.)<br><br>Of course it's not just dancing where incomes, connections, venues, arts, and activities disappeared. Worldwide, folks are isolated, lonely, lacking so much, afraid for the future and wishing things were otherwise.<br><br>Really, just like always.<br><br>So yes anxiety has been all over social media feeds.<br><br>And till now I\u2019ve done pretty well with keeping my personal take on this to myself, since people have a right to find their own way without my two cents.<br><br>This time though, like a couple of other times, apparently the gods had had enough and Judy\u2019s fingers began to type.<br><br>Because the thing is, I work with a lot of anxious and depressed people. Every day.<br><br>More than that, I haven\u2019t struggled in this pandemic. In fact, I\u2019ve kind of liked it (she says, ducking for cover.)<br><br>That\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t miss dancing and hugging and the unconcerned, unthinking normalcy of my former everyday life. I would happily have all that back in a heartbeat.<br><br>But it\u2019s not coming back soon, and when it returns, most likely much will be different.<br><br>Which means I get the chance to watch these times we\u2019re living in become an actual day-to-day example,<br><br>a kind of primer, if you will,<br><br>of how woo-woo nonduality actually intersects with that which we\u2019ve all agreed to call, \u201creal life,\u201d<br><br>Actually integrates. Actually gets lived.<br><br>Rubber hitting the road.<br><br>As opposed to intellectually being just very nice in concept.<br><br>I mean, there are always a zillion such opportunities. But just by being so widespread,<br><br>the pandemic offers spiritual types the opportunity to walk their talk.<br><br>Because quite truly, THIS IS IT.<br><br>Don\u2019t like it? Still IT. Wish things were otherwise? Still IT. Want to hug your grandkids, get your job back, not worry about being alive tomorrow?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>We can yearn and regret and cry and try to control forces way bigger than we.<br><br>And life continues to be what it is and it ain\u2019t changing just because we don\u2019t want it.<br><br>This is not theory. Not conceptual. Not intellectual. &nbsp;<br><br>It's just existence. As it is. Which includes death and poverty and fear and loneliness and not knowing what to do and not getting what we want.<br><br>Fighting that feels awful. Fighting for control we don\u2019t have, fighting to make things our way when we have zero power, brings anxiety. Screaming \u201cBut I don\u2019t want it this way!\u201d causes suffering.<br><br>Ours.<br><br>Not to mention that we don\u2019t know everything, or see everything. We only know our own tiny little filtered viewpoint. There is so much that never enters our screen.<br><br>How do we fix what we don\u2019t even know about?<br><br>Thinking our limited experience on this planet ever provides enough of the big picture to actually fix existence, makes humans crazy.<br><br>Because, don\u2019t know. Because, believe lies. Because, confirmation bias. Because, arrogance, know-it-all-while-knowing-nothing, insignificance.<br><br>Because This Is It.<br><br>So we might find it easier to adapt. We might find it easier to yield.<br><br>In fact, we might find it easier,<br><br>even revelatory,<br><br>to BE existence,<br><br>rather than see ourselves as outside it, evaluating, directing, and fighting life.<br><br>Being experience, being life, being fear, being others, being advice, being rule-breaking, being reaction.<br><br>As opposed to the one experiencing and witnessing and evaluating all that.<br><br>This brings conceptual nonduality to a screetching \"real-life\" integration.<br><br>This, is truly, \u201conly one.\u201d<br><br>Yeah yeah fine, but who cares? Especially when there are \"real\" problems and worries.<br><br>Well of course no one has to care.<br><br>But if we're really tired of anxiety and suffering, it could be that even just considering this shift in viewpoint,<br><br>even when it feels like we\u2019re not doing it \u201cright,\u201d<br><br>can help anxiety fade away.<br><br>On its own.<br><br>Even if circumstances do or don't change.<br><br>Because BEING what is<br><br>IS<br><br>what is.<br><br>And that<br><br>turns out to BE<br><br>everything. &nbsp;<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here<\/a> to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<br><br>---------------<br><br><em>\"You are convinced that if<br>You can but manage...<br>Your mind<br>Your money<br>Your breath<br>Your energy<br>Your body<br>Your faith<br>Your relationships<br>Your prayers<br><br>You will unlock the door<br>To peace, happiness and contentment.<br><br>Guess again.\"<br>--Ram Tzu<br><\/em><br><br><br><br><img src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/ac5b1302-546b-4f71-aa88-8755b247316b.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width: 27.08%;\">","extra":""}
