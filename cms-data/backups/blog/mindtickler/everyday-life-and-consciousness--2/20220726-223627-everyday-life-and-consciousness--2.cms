Just enough so that you don't step in front of a bus.\"<br>--Shunryo Suzuki<br><br>----------<br><br>\u201cIf you didn't have an ego and you were hungry, you would pick up food but not know whose mouth to put it into.\u201d<br>-Twitter user<\/em><br><br><br>If you\u2019ve been following The Mind-Tickler for a while, you know that we approach the traditional bigger-picture isms like consciousness and awareness and enlightenment by entering through the back-door of everyday life.<br><br>The hurts, shames, guilts, worries about not enough money or time, self-improvement schemes, lack of proper housekeeping, anger at family or phone company or traffic, etc etc etc. That's what is found in these Ticklers.<br><br>You know, all the lowly miserable life-stuff most of us Do Not Want.<br><br>Why does the Mind-Tickler enter through the everyday instead of talking only about awareness, you may be asking with fascination?<br><br>Well, firstly, because whether it is or isn\u2019t true that there is no self, or that this life is a dream or illusion, or that there is or isn\u2019t Choice, there is little value in babbling on about any of that ad nauseam, as it seems so many spiritual folks are wont to do.<br><br>And second, because the reason most people have any interest in enlightenment, awareness or consciousness to begin with, is to help their daily life feel better. They want to find a way to experience feeling OK no matter what difficult situations happen. They want to not miss out. They want to feel safe, to love, be loved, live better.<br><br>All of which happens in the everyday.<br><br>And we can only explore reality and consciousness, figure out who we are, have the bolt of lightening, from there.<br><br>The human \u201cpart\u201d of us, the illusion, the dream character, is what knows and experiences any thing.&nbsp;From right here in the everyday.<br><br>So we can\u2019t do without it.<br><br>And yet, so many seekers pooh-pooh the ordinariness of daily life. They want to overcome, see through, transcend. Only big, grand, whole, blissful expansiveness will do.<br><br>You know. You\u2019ve seen it. \u201cThat rage or terror I\u2019m feeling about being fired isn\u2019t happening to&nbsp;Me, because there&nbsp;is&nbsp;no me.\u201d Or, \u201cRelax- there\u2019s no you paying the bills.\u201d<br><br>Daily experience is considered in-the-way ego, an obstacle standing between the seeker and the sought.<br><br>Somehow folks don't notice that there&nbsp;is&nbsp;no enlightenment without the simultaneous dream experience of the everyday self.<br><br>After all, without it, there\u2019s no way to know they\u2019ve achieved the oneness they seek, that they\u2019ve \u201cgotten it.\u201d<br><br>\u201cOh I feel bliss.\u201d \u201cOh look I see there\u2019s no me.\u201d \u201cOh look, my partner\u2019s behavior is no longer upsetting.\u201d<br><br>Notice how any of this is known. Notice what knows this.<br><br>Checking the self\u2019s observations and experiences is the only way to know anything.<br><br>Because the everyday&nbsp;is where anything exists at&nbsp;all.<br><br>Even if it actually doesn\u2019t exist. Especially if it actually doesn\u2019t exist.<br><br>We may be consciousness and not the body, we may be the screen and not the content on it. But that content, that story, is what gives consciousness something to be consciousness OF.<br><br>So wholeness includes the nasty neighbor and the cruel illness and delusion and ego and all the persons with all their weird little quirks and preferences.<br><br>The everyday is an integral part of the whole and can not be brushed away, disregarded, or discounted.<br><br>There is nothing to be enlightened without the self.<br><br>Which perhaps is why so many teachers say, \u201cNothing changes\u201d with realization.<br><br>Political views continue, upsets with disagreement or criticism continue, addictions or compulsions continue.&nbsp;No matter how aware of awareness we may be,&nbsp;the trigger-happy, incomplete, not-enough, fruitcake self is still here, long after we see that none of that is what we are.<br><br>Maybe it lightens. Maybe it doesn't. Still&nbsp;the sense of Me remains the only vehicle through which we know and experience everything.<br><br>This can not stop just by seeing that we&nbsp;are&nbsp;everything.<br><br>And&nbsp;either\/or- either unseeing self or enlightened non-self- is not how things work.<br><br>Both&nbsp;and\u200b is the way consciousness rolls.<br><br>So there\u2019s no need to threaten to jump in front of a bus to prove the reality or unreality of the self, or to angrily wonder, if we don\u2019t exist, whose arthritis this is. There\u2019s no need to do away with thoughts and wacky actions and unpleasant triggers of the sense we\u2019ve come to know as Me.<br><br>There\u2019s no need to get awareness or enlightenment or awakening right. Because it\u2019s already right and already included.<br><br>We are the bus, we are the arthritis, we are the hated feelings and the everyday stress and the horrifying suffering. We are the expansivenses and the bliss and the love.<br><br>We are Me and also not-me, self and also not-self.<br><br>We get to have it all. We get to be it all.<br><br>The everyday is the divine, living right there in the ordinary.<br><br>Which is just what the daily appearance of life,<br><br>that often unwanted and disliked backdoor,<br><br>may show us,<br><br>as it opens to something much much larger<br><br>than the door itself.<br><br><br><br><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/a><\/strong><br><br><br><em>\u201cI am ... the divine expression exactly as I am, right here, right now. You are the divine expression exactly as you are, right here, right now. It is the divine expression, exactly as it is, right here, right now. Nothing, absolutely nothing, needs to be added or taken away. Nothing is more valid or sacred than anything else. No conditions need to be fulfilled. The infinite is not somewhere else waiting for us to become worthy\u2026. There is no need to wait for moments of transformation, to look for the non-doer, permanent bliss, an egoless state, or a still mind. I don't even have to wait for grace to descend, for I am, you are, it is already the abiding grace.\"<br>--Tony Parsons<br><br>----------<br><br>\u201cThe creature who says<br>\u201cme\u201d and \u201cmine\u201d<br>need not bend down in shame---<br>along with lakes and mountains<br>the ego is created<br>and divine.\u201d<br>--Leonard Cohen<br><\/em><br><br>","extra":"","extra2":""}
