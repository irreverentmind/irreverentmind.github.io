Which is a darn good thing.<br><br>Because posting our work is required, and post after post after post after post (ok I won\u2019t do that 1400 times) is, \u201cOMG it\u2019s awful,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m so embarrassed,\u201d and \u201cI almost didn\u2019t post this,\u201d and \u201cNo one 'Likes' my work so it must be because I\u2019m not good.\u201d<br><br>Yep, 1400<em>, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not good enough<\/em> individuals.<br><br>Perhaps this class somehow gathered up only 1400 particularly insecure people.<br><br>But it\u2019s unlikely all the secure ones took some other class. So no.<br><br>The funny things is, a significant portion of participants are successful professionals supporting themselves with their painting. They are very used to posting their art online, and the work shown is pretty much always quite beautiful.<br><br>But it doesn\u2019t matter. Because when it comes to themselves, no one thinks so.<br><br>So the word that keeps coming up in class is, \u201cvulnerability.\u201d<br><br>Hmmm. What is vulnerable, and to what, specifically?&nbsp;There\u2019s no literal danger, no literal exposure. What real thing is exposed? What real thing is seen? What is threatened by some comments on social media?<br><br>Perhaps insecure is just what humans are.<br><br>The self is not secured, apparently.<br><br>And my gosh, it's so very confused.<br><br>Because it's pretending that paint- or anything humans might produce- is \u201can extension\u201d of whatever it is we are. It's pretending there\u2019s actual exposure of the self in random splatters, or in any other production.<br><br>As if what comes out of a paintbrush or keyboard or golf club or tennis racket or anything else- means something about&nbsp;us.<br><br>As a person.<br><br>So in this painting class, I am repeatedly struck by how fragile the ego is.<br><br>How delicate! How frightened of others' thoughts. How desperate to control an image and story, by only posting nice and approved-of things.&nbsp;Making itself tiny and unnoticed.<br><br>And then, so quickly, so immediately! It is calmed and soothed and relieved simply by a few compliments and encouraging words.<br><br>All it takes to ease \"vulnerability\" is a few \"I love it!\" comments.<br><br>Weird.<br><br>Still, fear keeps making itself known, by folks not showing up to class, or procrastinating (for a class they were eager to take,) or lurking without posting.<br><br>It starts to be clear, watching these talented artists, that being a person is terrifying.<br><br>Perhaps this is why humans are so often anxious.<br><br>Perhaps this is also why we\u2019re always seeking \u2013 in so many different ways- to connect, meld, and to be included with the Larger-Than-Us.<br><br>We're calmed by loving inclusion.<br><br>Fear in everyone- painters and non-painters alike- seems (in part) to be terror of&nbsp;not&nbsp;being part of that greater whole.<br><br>We're terrified that we might be the one person left out of the vastness, the one loser standing outside. The fear is that we might be the one terrible, outside-the-big-tent, outside-the-garden, exclusion.<br><br><em>Is it just me? Am I the single exception? Am I the one terrible one?<\/em> is awful in its aloneness.<br><br>We want inclusion so as not to feel the individuality and personhood we\u2019ve spent lifetimes faking.<br><br>Even though we know we\u2019re not that. Even though we feel what we&nbsp;are.<br><br>Which, whatever it may be, is no individual.<br><br>Luckily though, no amount of perceived or anticipated failure- no bad painting, no missed tennis shot, no crappy writing-<br><br>changes what we are.<br><br>Whether it\u2019s seen or not, exposed or not, felt or not,<br><br>we\u2019re already included in the garden.<br><br>Because really, where else can we be?<br><br><em>We ARE the garden.<\/em><br><br>Which means that exposure we so fear<br><br>is nothing real.<br><br>Just like us.<br><br><br><em>\"Split me,<br>tear me apart,<br>fling me across the fabric of space and time.<br>Make me nothing and from nothing, make me everything.\"<br>--Rumi<\/em><br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<br><\/a><br><br><img align=\"center\" alt=\"\" src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/1658873872439.jpg\" width=\"321.47999999999996\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 28%;\"><br>","extra":"","extra2":""}
