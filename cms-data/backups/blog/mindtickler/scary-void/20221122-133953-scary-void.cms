This turned out later to be one of several, though I didn\u2019t know that then.<br><br>I wasn\u2019t looking for enlightenment, in fact couldn\u2019t care less about making such a thing happen.<br><br>Regardless here it was- a sudden knowing that Judy was a hologram. A sudden watching the lifetime movie of creating, projecting and protecting that \u201cJudy\u201d image. Knowing that an image is not a person.<br><br>Seeing that Judy had never been more than a dreaming, with no location, no center. Seeing that even what appeared to be her body, and others\u2019 bodies, and the cat, and the bed, were false concepts.<br><br>If she was anything, she was Experiencing, solidified into an experience-er.<br><br>All of which literally somehow knocked Judy\u2019s non-body right off the bed.<br><br>And from the floor, can you guess came next?<br><br>Do you imagine it was blissful, peaceful, transcendent?<br><br>No.<br><br>What came next was fear.<br><br>Well, terror, to be more accurate. Big fat unreasoning terror.<br><br>After all, I had been a person, a self, with a history, and preferences, and body. I knew who I was.<br><br>Ok sure, I didn\u2019t like her much, but at least I had the reassurance of knowing who I was dealing with.<br><br>And then an unasked-for flash seemed to turn a clear obvious&nbsp;Me&nbsp;into a clear obvious&nbsp;Naught.<br><br>Void. Empty. Nothing.<br><br>No self. No me. No Judy.<br><br>Gone.<br><br>Something that once was, something I could count on with familiarity- good ol\u2019 ME, MY self- somehow now wasn\u2019t.<br><br>Eek.<br><br>In the years since that time, I\u2019ve discovered that it\u2019s actually very common for folks to be terrified after getting a glimpse that they\u2019re not what they thought.<br><br>I mean, are we supposed to enjoy being here and then suddenly gone and unfindable? Are we supposed to enjoy that huge new lack where there wasn\u2019t lack before?<br><br>Though on closer scrutiny, the whole idea is kind of wacky really.<br><br>First, because we\u2019re saying the&nbsp;self is so powerful that it can - and does- make&nbsp;itself&nbsp;disappear just by seeing something.<br><br>And second, yes we might mourn the loss of illusion, loss of importance, loss of being center of all things.<br><br>But since we\u2019ve just seen that&nbsp;none of that was ever there to begin with,&nbsp;what exactly has gone missing?<br><br>What is afraid of its loss? What is being mourned, and what is mourning?<br><br>How nice that fear happens just as we are supposedly being set free of the false burden of self.<br><br>Turns out fear is an effective subject-changer, calling attention away from, \u201cOh!\u201dand sending it right back to, \"I'm the one right here, feeling stuff.\"<br><br>Conveniently resolidifying the sense of self, and bringing us back to the familiar, habitual Me.<br><br>Reifying the sense of Me once again.<br><br>So the panic of, \u201cOh no what happens to Me now?\u201d simply continues the business-as-usual importance of self.<br><br>Funnily enough.&nbsp;(Are you laughing yet?)<br><br>Because of course we\u2019re also still here.<br><br>Same bed, same past, same personality, same likes and dislikes.<br><br>The story of Me carries on.<br><br>Nothing is gone.<br><br>I mean, where would it go?<br><br>Besides, what can be lost if it was never there to begin with?<br><br>Not to mention, if we know there\u2019s a void, then there\u2019s a Me that knows this.<br><br>In which case, we\u2019re not gone, and therefore, there\u2019s no void.<br><br>Y\u2019know?<br><br>Meanwhile, whatever we are,<br><br>whatever that is,<br><br>it continues to be what it has always been.<br><br>Regardless of whether we suddenly \u201csee through it\u201d or not.<br><br>Emptiness is not empty.<br><br>There is no void.<br><br>Nothingness is not possible.<br><br>Because there has to be something, in order for there to be nothing.<br><br>Now of course, we\u2019re free to be afraid. And of course fear is fine.<br><br>It\u2019s just perhaps unnecessary, as we see the possible ploy of distraction.<br><br>Because even if there is indeed no self, and never has been,<br><br>whatever remains is<br><br>not nothing.<br><br>It might even be the opposite of nothing.<br><br>It might even be<br><br>quite something.<br><br><br><em>\"That which is unreal never is, and that which is real never is not.\"<br>--Krishna<\/em><br><br>----------<br><em><br>\"We are nothing, let us be all.\"<br>--Tony Parsons<br><br>----------<br><br>\"Since in reality all is void,<br>Whereon can the dust fall?\"<br>--Hui Neng<br><br>----------<br><br>\"Being nothing, I am all.
