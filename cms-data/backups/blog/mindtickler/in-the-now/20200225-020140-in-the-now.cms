The now was missing, whereabouts unknown.<br><br><em>Yooo hooo\u2026. The noooowwww\u2026<\/em><br><br>The post was touching in its sincerity. Perhaps that\u2019s why 140 commenters had sage advice to help this person finally get to where they wanted to be.<br><br>For example:<br><br>\u201cPain is necessary to know the now.\u201d Oh yay! BDSM spirituality.<br><br>\u201cYour mind takes you out of it.\u201d Ah. Takes you to where? No info provided.<br><br>\u201cSnap a rubber band whenever you leave the now.\u201d &nbsp;Is that like Dorothy clicking her heels? \u201cThere\u2019s no place like the now.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou need proper training. Message me.\u201d &nbsp;Yep. New-client-scoring opportunity- check.<br><br>\u201cWatch your breath.\u201c This was by far the most popular advice and strategy for proper now-ness.<br><br>Though \u201cwatching\u201d the breath, a form of meditation that many have at some point attempted, is extremely uninteresting to the mind. The mind is totally bored by presence.<br><br>Which is why, seconds after moving focus to the breath, attention shifts to figuring out how to solve life's problems- maybe get more money or a better relationship or a plan for dinner.<br><br>This was apparently what this poster above was experiencing. Their mind wandered, as minds do.<br><br>The poster took that to mean they\u2019d left the now.<br><br>Because for them and so many commenters, the now only happens with human attention. &nbsp;Take eyes off it for a second, and boom! Now is out the door again. So it needs rubber bands and pain and reminders to make it stick around.<br><br>As if the human mind, the very same one that skitters quickly away from the now, is the only thing that can actually hold the now in place.<br><br>Which of course makes no sense, though it is the common wisdom.<br><br>People mistake human<em>&nbsp;attention<\/em>, focus, for the now. They think they\u2019re the same thing.<br><br>Meanwhile, why do people even want to be in the now, anyway? What for?<br><br>There are only 3 reasons anyone would care.<br>They want to feel better.<br>They want in on some amazing experience they\u2019ve heard about but seem left out of, and\/or<br>They want to do the right thing, be good, live right.<br>Being in the now has become a requirement, a rule or strategy, for the right way to live.<br><br>As if there is such a thing.<br><br>And as if focus on the present moment is the only approved option. Focus on anything else is just wrong.<br><br>So when existence has the nerve to provide some other focus, like perhaps running thoughts about work or a \"bad\" feeling, humans say, \u201cNo no no, that\u2019s not right.\u201d<br><br>Which is peculiar.<br><br>Because even the scampering mind is happening now.<br><br>No matter what it is attending to, no matter what it is thinking about.<br><br>Thinking about the breath, thinking about day to day life, thinking about feelings- same.<br><br>All happening now, all included in now.<br><br>Though that desired attention on the approved right subjects might actually serve a purpose, too. Since it leaves us more aware of the self, rather than less.<br><br>Focus on the breath of the me, the in-the-now of the me, discounts all of existence\u2019s infinite <em>other<\/em> options.<br><br>Which is kind of small. Kind of me-centered. Kind of self-conscious. Kind of all about the self and how it\u2019s doing.<br><br>I mean, if one wants to do things right\u2026<br><br>that might not be it.<br><br>Because clearly the now is already here. All the time. There\u2019s nothing else. It can\u2019t go anywhere. There\u2019s nothing outside it.<br><br>The now certainly does not need humans to pay attention to it.<br><br>Which is another way of saying, \u201cThis is it.\u201d And is as now as it gets.<br><br>The poster asking for help above simply hadn't noticed they already had all the now they could ever want.<br><br>Right now.<br><br>So... what now?<br><br>Laughter. Crying. Dinner. Poverty. Thinking. Meditating. Pain. Desires. Sunshine.<br><br>And the clich\u00e9-because-it\u2019s-the-only-option-no-matter-what-is-happening<br><br>of<br><br>Now. Now.
