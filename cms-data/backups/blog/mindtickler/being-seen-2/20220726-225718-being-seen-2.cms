The rest is drag.\u201d<br>--Ru Paul<br><\/em><br><br>Some years ago at a dance I was talking with some friends and a man came up to ask one of us to dance. She turned him down, needing a rest. The man then walked away, ignoring the rest of us. We looked at each other and then someone said, \u201cWhat are we, invisible?\u201d<br><br>Or recently on social media, a woman started a long discussion noting that people get invisible as we age. Hundreds were in agreement, all greatly lamenting being invisible.<br><br>Meanwhile this same poster\u2019s website is covered with pictures of herself. No invisibility for her, thank you very much.<br><br>Then there was my elderly mom in her nursing home, also trying hard not to be invisible. There she was in her eighties, trying to impress all the aged folks in wheelchairs, making sure they thought she was good-looking and well-dressed and fun at dinner, emphasizing her old successes and life achievements with, ahem, embellishments.<br><br>How people saw my mother was very important to her right up to her chosen dying day, when she carefully planned the clothes she\u2019d wear when she was found.<br><br>Let\u2019s face it, as long as we\u2019re alive (and maybe even after,) being invisible is bad.<br><br>Folks want to be seen.<br><br>Dammit, look at me! Look at me being attractive, look at me being smart and knowing things, look at me being cool and unconcerned, look at me being funny, look at me donating \u201canonymously\u201d and then casually telling people what I did. (\u201cOh it\u2019s nothing; I just like to help people.\u201d)<br><br>Hey let\u2019s take a selfie! And then we\u2019ll post it.<br><br>Because, y\u2019know, SEEN.<br><br>By others.<br><br>But only if it\u2019s a good picture. Only if we show up good looking, smart, successful, a winner. Only if by seeing us, others will have a good image of us, as our best in their eyes, head, and opinion.<br><br>Because look out if we can\u2019t make them think the right things about us. Look out if we can\u2019t be sure we\u2019ll perform well in the concert, can\u2019t be sure the boss will be impressed, can\u2019t be sure people will view us positively in some social situation.<br><br>Eek. Then we\u2019re scared. Then we're anxious. Then labels show up like social anxiety or performance anxiety or lack of motivation or agoraphobia or introversion or co-dependence.<br><br>Yep. One wrong move and being seen is terrible.<br><br>Be seen badly by others and&nbsp;hello depression, hello addiction, hello&nbsp;secrets and hiding and never leaving the house.<br><br>Invisibility would be absolutely welcome at that point.<br><br>So it becomes imperative- as in, not an option- to attempt to control the narrative about us. We must appear to control how we are seen by others or pay a scary price.<br><br>Naturally we work incessantly, compulsively, to make that happen. Constantly putting lipstick on the ol\u2019 proverbial pig.<br><br>Meanwhile\u2026 <em>Seen, looking good, looking bad, appear, invisible.&nbsp;<\/em>Have you noticed these are all visual words?<br><br>They\u2019re all words denoting image.<br><br>And what real thing cares so much about image and how it looks, that well into old age it may still be trying to control how the self is presented to others? What real thing wants that so badly?<br><br>Not to mention, what real thing has to work so hard to be seen in the first place?&nbsp;Why isn\u2019t it a given? I see a lamp, I see a cat \u2013 neither has to bother working to be \u201cseen.\u201d&nbsp;Why does it take so much careful human effort and attention- just to appear in someone else\u2019s eyeballs?<br><br>Could it be because there\u2019s nothing more real or substantial available to be?<br><br>What we see in the mirror is image; that reflection is not a person. Photos are pictures; they're not a person.<br><br>What we call personality, mind or ego is not a person.<br><br>Even the body is not a person. It\u2019s meat, animated by who knows what.<br><br>But hey, at least the body can be&nbsp;seen.&nbsp;Look, there it is. There I am. Right there.<br><br>Perhaps this explains why we so often confuse the body with what we are.<br><br>I mean, we can\u2019t see the darn thing ourselves. We'll never see our own face, our own back, our own nose.<br><br>We need others for that. And images-&nbsp;images in mirrors, images in pictures.<br><br>Something that can reflect us. To prove we exist.<br><br>Otherwise there\u2019s no self at all.<br><br>We\u2019re an image or we\u2019re nothing.<br><br>Self image becomes key to maintaining the illusion- the hologram- we puff up every day.&nbsp;There\u2019s nothing else to back the sense of \u201cme\u201d up.<br><br>So yes we do care, and to some degree always will care, what people think about us.<br><br>Because we need them to prove us.<br><br>So we\u2019ll continue to get mad or depressed or scared when someone doesn\u2019t think we\u2019re wonderful. We\u2019ll continue to try to look good in front of the new honey, to not be seen having something in our teeth, to not miss the easy shots on the golf course or have a hole in our pants or say the wrong thing at a party.<br><br>Because image is the ball and chain that ties us to the sense of individuality, the sense of being a real and solid person.<br><br>Giving a crap what some other thinks about us is part of that tether.<br><br>Being seen makes us feel like some thing. It's all we've got.<br><br>Even though an image will always be no thing.<br><br>Still, that just might be something<br><br>worth seeing.<br><br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<br><\/a><br><br><em>\"It sees itself.
