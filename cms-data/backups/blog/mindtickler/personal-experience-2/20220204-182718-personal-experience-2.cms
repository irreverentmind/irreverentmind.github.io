For most everyone, first-hand knowledge is the final arbiter of reality and Truth.<br><br>Even though by definition, \"personal experience\" means, specific to Me, with all my unique slants, perspectives, conclusions, information and thoughts.<br><br>Y\u2019know, person-al.<br><br>There are the colors and shapes seen in our eyeballs, sounds heard in our ears, touch experienced in our fingertips, our skin receptors. There are emotions felt in our bodies, aided and interpreted by thoughts we also call ours.<br><br>Let\u2019s face it, we only know what\u2019s what when it comes through our filters.<br><br>Otherwise, we can't know anything.<br><br>At all.<br><br>Which means that all experience is always specific only to us. Which means it has nothing to do with objective Truth.<br><br>And when we presume that it does, we\u2019re basically saying, \u201cMy way is the way. What I encounter is all there is.\u201d<br><br>Which is only just a little arrogant. Ok maybe a lot arrogant.<br><br>Because this know-it-all-ness, based strictly on what we see, hear and feel personally, is kind of breathtaking.<br><br>I mean here we are experiencing, and somehow we come to believe that these particular-to-us happenings prove something about the \u201creal world,\u201d a supposedly fact-based, unbiased, and independent real thing.<br><br>We're quite certain of this.<br><br>Even though, when we do perceive anything, those perceptions are still only our eyes, ears, fingertips, experiencing.<br><br>Personal truth. Not objective truth.<br><br>Can you say \"projection,\" boys and girls?<br><br>It\u2019s not like this is just sometimes, either. No, we\u2019re 100% projecting our personal experience at all times, non-stop.<br><br>And calling it, \"reality.\"<br><br>So for those who enjoy being important or special- which is pretty much everyone - at least this is good news.<br><br>Because it means that we were right- we are the center of the universe; it is all just us projected out into everything. We are necessary. We matter.<br><br>Whooo hooo! We knew it!<br><br>Oddly enough though, it can also be good news for those who are interested in the idea of Enlightenment and No-Self, too.<br><br>Because when we begin to see that our Very Important Personal Experience is only a viewpoint, and that all of our, \u201cOf course reality is real!\u201d certainty can only ever be projection\u2026<br><br>Our usually-strong sense of being an individual with a translatable experience may just begin to get wispy.<br><br>Because when we don\u2019t lug around all the limitation that comes with \u201cobjective reality,\u201d the sense of self may begin to feel lighter and less concrete.<br><br>Now of course I\u2019m not saying that any of this is ever the least bit necessary. It\u2019s just that many lovely Mind-Tickler readers happen to be curious about this particular individual-not-individual, self-not-self, thing.<br><br>And as a doorway in, the consideration of what is real vs what is our biased, deceptively separate experience, can be very enlightening.<br><br>Even though no amount of considering will ever reveal what is actually real.<br><br>Because we will never be able to get outside these perceiving machines.<br><br>So an undebatable, unalterable Truth which is not tainted by or based on personal experience- something outside the self-<br><br>is something we will never know.<br><br>Because it can't be known. Not by us little humans, anyway.<br><br>Which is fine.
