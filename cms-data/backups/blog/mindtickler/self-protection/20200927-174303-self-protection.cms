L. Mencken<\/em><br><br><br>It used to be so much easier to love my friends and family before their political opinions were stabbing fingers in my face 24\/7. &nbsp;<br><br>People I\u2019ve known for years, hugged, danced with, toasted over Thanksgiving, people I know to be good folks, kind people of integrity\u2026<br><br>Now divided into \u201csides,\u201d into closed camps- with scorn and righteous certainty as requirements for entry, along with some version of the password, \u201cI agree with you!\u201d<br><br>You\u2019d think it would take a lot to foment divisiveness among loved ones, considering both teams say the same exact things about the other, both call the other identical names, both blame the other for starting and perpetuating trouble.<br><br>But no. No one seems to have any problem screaming at the mirror.<br><br>And oh my gosh, the rage. Percolating even through should-be-harmless situations, like what color a hat is.<br><br>Identical, regardless-of-point-of-view rage. &nbsp;<br><br>It\u2019s a wonder people can breathe.<br><br>And yet not only can folks breathe while spitting fire, they seek out the fire, turning every conversation and post into an opportunity to position their worldview and stoke further fury.<br><br>It almost seems like a responsibility to convert the other team to our side.<br><br>In fact, we may even think rage is necessary to effect change, that no action will be taken if we\u2019re not out of our head with frenzy.<br><br>Anger seems necessary.<br><br>And we like it. We like the outrage. We look for it, feed on it, join groups to get more of it.<br><br>Furious intensity is the mind\u2019s idea of a good time. It doesn\u2019t want us calm.<br><br>Because indignation lets us know our position, our stance, our side.<br><br>Which, interestingly, are all words indicating geography. As in, \u201cHere I am. Here\u2019s me taking a stand on this battle ground.\u201d<br><br>Guess it's called \"identity politics\" for a reason.<br><br>We identify as \u201cme\u201d through opinion.<br><br>As well as by association with a side. Because selves without agreeing-other selves are \u201cvulnerable.\u201d<br><br>Although it's unclear, vulnerable to what, as in, what is protected and made stronger by screaming and side-taking and agreement?<br><br>We defend our position. With keyboard, flags, yelling and pepper spray,<br><br>we make our presence known.<br><br>That old reliable, years-nurtured sense of self- created, guarded, defended and maintained via viewpoint.<br><br>Now <em>that<\/em>- that sense of who we are- that\u2019s something worth fighting for. <em>That\u2019s<\/em> something to defend with everything we\u2019ve got.<br><br>Funny though <em>(you laughing yet?)<\/em>, because fury doesn\u2019t actually protect anything. Screaming and opinion can\u2019t protect anything real.<br><br>Which means it\u2019s not really the sense of self that is in danger of exposure by disagreement.<br><br>In fact we\u2019re <em>all for&nbsp;<\/em>that being seen. We want that seen.<br><br>That\u2019s why we\u2019re so loud about it.<br><br>No, what is successfully hidden by rage and point of view, is the lack of self. The quiet, the empty, not-thereness.<br><br>That wispy not-there no-self.<br><br><em>That's<\/em> what is \u201cvulnerable.\u201d<br><br>Get quiet for a moment, stop defending and screaming our opinions for half a second,<br><br>and we\u2019re truly afraid we\u2019ll disappear.<br><br>Turns out we\u2019d much rather yell and fight than see that we\u2019re not what we think we are.<br><br>Which might sound like extreme spiritual blah-blah, till we notice we\u2019ll go to any length including death, not to see this.<br><br>Agreement-seeking rage is an obscuring distraction, a basic way the self presents, a core strategy of mind.<br><br>Points of view and aligning with tribes pretend to establish our existence.<br><br>We cannot allow them to let up.<br><br>Which is why fury at disagreement has been around for thousands of years, and is not going to stop being around anytime soon.<br><br>So trying to calm down, trying to have a reasonable conversation (with no yelling or name calling), trying to let others have their views without being triggered, is verrrry difficult. Usually it comes with tremendous effort and gritted teeth.<br><br>Eventually we use words like, \"I can't take it anymore,\" and resort to the block button to cut out people we used to love and enjoy.<br><br>We have to defend the sense of self from those barbarians. It's only right.<br><br>Now to be clear, I\u2019m not saying this shouldn't happen this way. I'm not saying we should be \u201cspiritual\u201d and focus on positivity or enlightenment or any of that other bypassing nonsense. &nbsp;I\u2019m also not saying anyone should try to exist without a point of view, maybe even a strong point of view. <em>&nbsp;(good thing, since being viewpoint-less is not possible.)<\/em><br><br>And I\u2019m certainly not dismissing the sense of importance of opinion in these times.<br><br>It\u2019s just that, if we can see the purpose served by our points of view, we might be able to do without quite so much self protection.<br><br>Only because the ferocious defense of illusion makes us crazy. Hate-filled. Mean.<br><br>Delusion makes us less effective, less right, and less able to step outside the usual boxes in order to think straight and find solutions.<br><br>Clarity enables us to stand a chance.<br><br>And right now, goodness knows we can all use a stance and a chance.<br><br>Because in the end, hugging friends and loved ones<br><br>rather than cutting them off with hatred,<br><br>is what all of us pretend-selves<br><br>really want anyway.<br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br>Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week<\/a>.<br><br><img align=\"center\" alt=\"\" src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/1599067786590.jpg\" width=\"334.8\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 25.13%;\">","extra":""}
