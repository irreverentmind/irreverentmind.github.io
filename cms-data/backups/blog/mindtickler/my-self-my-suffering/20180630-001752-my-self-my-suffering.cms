NOW!\u201d<br><br>When we hurt, it feels like we must focus on the circumstances and the content of story. We spend countless hours stewing about how to fix the situation, undo the past, quit the addiction, get more money, win back the love, save the polar bears or get to better times.<br><br>We want \"better\"- feelings, situations, health, partners, parents, past.<br><br>Almost everyone wants a better \u201cme\u201d.<br><br>That\u2019s how suffering very effectively draws our attention away from noticing that the self is just a story.<br><br>Attempting to make \u201cbetter\u201d happen, we may turn to anything outside ourselves. &nbsp;We're all familiar with this; it looks like every addition we've ever had.<br><br>We may not see that even therapy, inquiry, or the search for enlightenment are also solution-seeking ploys.<br><br>All of that better-seeking activity is very effective at anchoring and confirming a sense of self.<br><br>And that's exactly what all hurting and problems are there for- to occupy attention.<br><br>Because in the focus on the circumstances of hurting, the fiction of Self can remain unnoticed.<br><br>In fact, we often secretly cling to maintaining our suffering, because it\u2019s so effective at misdirecting attention.<br><br>We don\u2019t want to let suffering go.
