No fear is so small or petty that the fear of no-self isn't at its heart. All fear is ultimately fear of no-self.\"<br>--Jed McKenna<\/em><br><em><br><\/em><br>Many years ago I was the lead presenter in a business situation. I did the hours-long thing, helped some folks, answered some questions. It went great. I wore my lucky suit. I was confidant, in command, capable.<br><br>Afterwards, I watched the video.<br><br>Wait, what was my face doing?<br><br>I looked afraid. For the entire recording.<br><br>That couldn\u2019t be right. I wasn\u2019t afraid! Well, not after the initial adrenaline nerves. Not once I got going.<br><br>But the darn face betrayed something else.<br><br>Oh no. Couldn\u2019t I go back in time, get better control of my face and self, and pretend that video away?<br><br>Well since TikTok and YouTube weren\u2019t invented yet, no.<br><br>Ever notice how much everyday, low-level fear humans drag around? &nbsp;<br><br>Constantly running in the background. An imperceptible hum. Familiar.<br><br>We\u2019re used to it.<br><br>I\u2019m not talking about the loud tonsil-showing screaming that happens when the fear-dial is ramped up to high. <em>That,<\/em> we do notice. <em>That<\/em> we name: nervousness, anxiety, terror, panic attack. We pay l<em>ots<\/em> of attention to<em>&nbsp;that.<\/em><br><br>No I\u2019m talking about thousands of tiny daily micro-fears. Teeny unacknowledged jolts of \u201cAck!\u201d &nbsp;<br><br>Every day. All day. Even asleep, in dreams.<br><br>We\u2019re afraid of phone calls. Answering the front door. Rips in pants, bugs, losing a game. Being awkward. Bad posture. Spinach in the teeth. Zeros. An untied shoelace. Looking old. Being old.<br><br>We\u2019re afraid our smoking will lead to early death, that heartburn is really a heart attack, we\u2019re ugly, people are laughing at us. We\u2019re afraid our yelling is messing up the kids, we said something stupid at the party, we blew the recital.<br><br>We\u2019re afraid of not sleeping enough, sleeping too much, the dark, being wrong, reading the news.<br><br>We\u2019re afraid of rain, empty streets, wasting our life, dying without getting enlightened, not knowing something, being late, forgetting a word, making the spouse angry.<br><br>I could go on and on.<br><br>So could you.<br><br>It begins to be clear that these human things are inherently afraid. All the time. Of absolutely everything.<br><br>But what for? There are no tigers around.<br><br>Could it be because the variable, contradictory, unprovable thing called \u201cmy self\u201d is afraid that it \u2026 isn\u2019t?<br><br>If that\u2019s true then, by golly, effort to keep that hidden must never let up. &nbsp;<br><br>Which is also scary. &nbsp;Because who the hell knows how to do that?<br><br>We do try though.<br><br>Mostly by trying to overcome all those little fears.<br><br>With procrastination, meditation, therapy, inquiry, retreats, positive affirmations, exercise, and spirituality. With pot, alcohol, sex, shopping, and chips.<br><br>Never-mind that none of that actually succeeds at stopping daily micro-fears from continuing.<br><br>Because when fear is at the absolute core, the very center, of being a separate self,<br><br>well, that\u2019s not overcome-able.<br><br>And certainly not by the separate self.<br><br>After all, that would be self defeating. &nbsp;<br><br>So at least maybe there can be some relief in seeing that anything that\u2019s not-there, anything that\u2019s nothing, actually has no need of protection or safety anyway.<br><br>Y'know, being illusion and all. &nbsp;<br><br>Whew. Nothing\u2019s starting to look pretty good.<br><br>Maybe even better than answering the phone.<br><br>Ok but if we can\u2019t eliminate fears, then what do we do with them?<br><br>Well, we live with them.<br><br>Like \u2018em or not.<br><br>We live with the face-betraying unease, the worry about weather, the heartbeat that happens with the doorbell.<br><br>Because low-level or high, some degree of fear comes with the human package. It is built in. It is not going anywhere.<br><br>Luckily, it\u2019s just fear.<br><br>It's just fear of fear.<br><br>It's just the self, afraid of being caught, being seen, as the wispy delusion it is.<br><br>No big deal.<br><br>It\u2019s nothing.<br><br>We\u2019re nothing.<br><br>Tigers can\u2019t eat that.<br><br>Which is an absolute and true safety.<br><br>And there's nothing scary there<br><br>at all.<br><br><em><br><\/em><em><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe and get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/a><\/strong><\/em><br><br><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&t=6s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Watch Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump<br><\/a><\/em><\/strong><br><em>Ram Tzu knows this. . .<br>The fear never leaves you.<br>It is part of you<br>As tied to your center as your breath.<br><br>Touch it,<br>Stroke it<br>Get to know it well.<br>As long as you are<br>It will be with you.<br><br>You scream<br>You shout<br>You rage<br>You want quit of it.<br>You push it away with all your strength.<br><br>But hear this. . .<br><br>It thrives on all the exercise<br>You give it.<br>It gets stronger when<br>You give it something to push up against.<br><br>Left alone it will wither and die.<br><br>But you know you can not leave it alone.<br>You must always fight the fear.<br>It is your nature to always fight.<br><br>Yet sometimes there is Grace . . .<br>You disappear into it<br>And there is no longer a battle.<br><br>The warrior is gone. &nbsp;<br>--Wayne Liquorman aka Ram Tzu<\/em><br><br><img align=\"center\" alt=\"\" src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/1624376107051.jpg\" width=\"118.44\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 8.74%;\">","extra":""}
