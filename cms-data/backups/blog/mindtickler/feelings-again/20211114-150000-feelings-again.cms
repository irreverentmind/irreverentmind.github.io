Evaluated based on feeling.<br><br>That's important.<br><br>Naturally then, there are many approaches for feelings management.<br><br>Many methods. Many experts. Many beliefs.<br><br>Allow, Welcome, Sit with, Breathe into, Listen to, Honor. Find out what lies beneath. Interpret meaning. Meditate (or medicate) so that the resulting calm leaks into other life situations later.<br><br>Though maybe we don\u2019t need all that instruction or control management. Maybe we can just check our own experience.<br><br>For instance when we\u2019re hurting, there\u2019s no question we\u2019re alive, is there?<br><br>Lots of people feel alive only when they\u2019re feeling intensely.<br><br>Otherwise they feel bored, numb, empty, dissatisfied.<br><br>For many many people, if there\u2019s too much peace, mind starts looking for the next problem to fret about.<br><br>Almost as if we can\u2019t bear to be separated from intensity for too long.<br><br>Almost as if, <em>I feel, therefore I exist.<\/em><br><br>Hmmm.<br><br>Could it be that feelings are a trick designed to draw our<br>attention away from something?<br><br>A situation arises, we feel \"bad,\" we can\u2019t focus on anything other than trying to feel \"better.\"<br><br>And what are we not noticing while our attention is all about some feeling?<br><br>Well for one thing\u2026 we don\u2019t notice what exactly is doing the allowing, sitting-with, validating, and interpreting.<br><br><em>What feels feelings?<\/em><br><br>What pays attention to them?

Well I feel it. I sense it. There\u2019s a sense of me.<\/em><br><br>That\u2019s our proof.

No less. Certainly no more.<br><br>So let's be clear, I\u2019m not belittling feeling. I'm not saying don't feel. I'm not saying bypass.<br><br>None of that's really a choice anyway.
