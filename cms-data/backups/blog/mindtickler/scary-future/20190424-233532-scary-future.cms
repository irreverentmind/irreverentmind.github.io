She saved the retirement money, ate the kale, wore the helmet.<br><br>And yet, along came \u201cAccident\u201d anyway.<br><br>What makes it an \u201caccident\u201d vs. an \u201con purpose?\u201d<br><br>Well, \u201caccident\u201d means it was unplanned-for. Which of course it was. No one could have planned for this.<br><br>Despite all those decades of midnight mental self-protection strategy sessions about how to be safe in the future.<br><br>So much for plans.<br><br>For most of us, out of the blue will come the who-could-have-known truck, the lightning, the going to sleep and not waking up. &nbsp;Very few get to tell death when, where and how to show up.<br><br>And when we begin to see that truly we have zero control despite all those great plans and intentions...<br><br>We start to understand why thought is terrified of the future. We start to understand why future-planning so often comes with fear, worry, and waking in the night just for anxious sweating.<br><br>Turns out, despite mind\u2019s constant focus on self protection, existence has its own ideas about what\u2019s supposed to happen next.<br><br>It is simply not going to be controlled by mind\u2019s plans.<br><br>I mean, talk about powerless.<br><br>And hoo boy, thought simply hates that.<br><br>Thought hates that it is not the boss of the future. It hates that it can plan and scheme to protect and in the end existence says, \u201cNo. Not that. This.\u201d anyway.<br><br>Nothing brings home our helpless know-nothingness better than the so-called future.<br><br>And dammit that's scary stuff.<br><br>Even though \"the future\" is only a concept, a bunch of mental images about things that haven\u2019t happened and usually never do happen.<br><br>Which mind somehow keeps failing to notice or accept.<br><br>Still, if we think about how many times we have been afraid of potential looming disaster vs. how many times said disaster actually happened, well\u2026<br><br>We might begin to see that thought is an exceptionally incompetent psychic.<br><br>That sucker is guessing. It truly has no idea what is actually going to happen. So it\u2019s always scurrying to protect against all possible contingencies.<br><br>Y\u2019know, for just in case.<br><br>While meanwhile, existence is like, \u201cOk, cue the surprise flat tire.\u201d<br><br>As it happens, we\u2019ve actually never been anything<em> other<\/em> than helpless anyway. Seen or not, admitted or not, understood or not...<br><br>We are experts in not knowing.<br><br>So there\u2019s actually nothing unknown or new about being helpless. It is already the case.<br><br>And here we are, carrying on carrying on.<br><br>Until it\u2019s time to <em>not<\/em> go on, of course. And we are not the boss of when that is.<br><br>So sure, the mind can busy itself trying to control the future. But it does not actually have that power.<br><br>Luckily, the future is a sheep in wolf\u2019s clothing anyway.<br><br>It looks scary but it\u2019s not real. And neither is the self that is looking to be protected.<br><br>They\u2019re both completely made up. As concepts always are.<br><br>Nice lambie. Nice lambie.<br><br>Meanwhile, oh to be able to go back in time and say once more to my sweet friend, \u201cThose fears of the future- the \u201cpotential\u201d poverty, the \u201ccould happen\u201d mistakes, the \u201cmight happen\u201d suffering\u2026 they\u2019re imagination. They\u2019re not real. The future isn\u2019t real. So maybe this right now can be enough?\u201d<br><br>I would so wish for her to be able to enjoy this anything-but-poor present, while it's here.<br><br>And of course, I can\u2019t bring her back to say any of that.<br><br>So I\u2019m saying it to you.<br><br>Because I wish this for you too- the noticing of your own part in this sweet present existence, as it is.<br><br>Surely that counts at least as much as all those imagined, fictitious maybe-might-could-happens.<br><br>Not to mention that when I share this with you, I\u2019m sharing with her too.<br><br>And thank you for that.<br><br><br><em>\"You need not strain towards the future- the future will come to you on its own.\" --Nisargadatta<br><\/em><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/a><br><br><br>In loving memory of Paula S. &nbsp;May there be peace where you are.<br><br>","extra":""}
