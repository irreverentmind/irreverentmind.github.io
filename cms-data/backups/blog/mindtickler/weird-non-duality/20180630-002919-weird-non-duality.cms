That causes you to think, <em>\"I'm not there yet.\"<\/em>","words":1280,"content":"So here\u2019s the weird thing about the non-dual scene.<br><br>Well, there are many weird things of course, but one of them is\u2026<br><br>It\u2019s full of mythology. Mythology that persists no matter what we see, hear or learn that contradicts it.<br><br>For instance, Alan Watts: \u201c<em>I have never yet met a saint or sage who did not have some human frailties.\u201d<br><\/em><br>You realize what that quote means, right?<br><br>It means that even after enlightenment, whatever that is or isn\u2019t, however it\u2019s defined\u2026<br><br>Life goes on. Humanness persists. Even saints and sages keep desiring, drinking, smoking, having sex, and, heaven forbid, reacting.<br><br>Of course this can be shocking to consider when so many insist that it's possible to become more than human. Although.... where does the human disappear to, Bermuda? &nbsp;But I digress.<br><br>In addition to being deliberately fed this dream in so many ways, we might be forgiven for wishing for perfection, simply because the story is so appealing. &nbsp;Most seekers are devoted to the myth of constant calm and smiles no matter what. Even though the untruth of that story has been revealed many times. (And when wise ones have supported this myth, all one needs to do is look at their personal off-stage life to see the contrast between words and deeds.)<br><br>All those teachers who say, \u201cChop wood, carry water?\u201d All those sages from Buddha on up who have written some version of \u201cNothing changes after enlightenment?\"<br><br>They mean it.<br><br>The honest ones essentially say, \u201cYes I have had experiences and still, life as it\u2019s been, goes on. This personality is here. I still feel things, I still think things, I\u2019m still \u201cme\u201d.\u201d<br><br>Anthony de Mello: <em>\u201cBefore enlightenment, I used to be depressed; after enlightenment, I continue to be depressed.\u201c<br><\/em><br>And yet, it seems we\u2019d much prefer to think, &nbsp;\u201cIf I do everything right and inquire more and get more present and see through the illusion of self, I will no longer be this messed up person. I will no longer be not good enough or unlovable or a failure. I will no longer get angry. I\u2019ll only be peaceful, blissful and content at all times for ever and ever, amen.\u201d<br><br>Not that it\u2019s so terrible that people are seeking a unicorn. Except that this set up keeps us chasing and dissatisfied, forever.<br><br>Adyashanti: <em>\u201cMost people think enlightenment is like an unending satori experience. But it\u2019s not an unending experience at all. It has nothing to do with an unending experience. That misunderstanding will get you to do more \u2018tail chasing\u2019 than you ever dreamed possible. In the end enlightenment has very little to do with enlightenment experiences. It is simply not perceiving through the lens of ego.\u201d<\/em><br><br>I mean, yes, maybe here and there we get lucky and some overt quirk of personality shifts, so that maybe we stop drinking for example, but basically\u2026<br><br>Whatever that personality is, remains.<br><br>That\u2019s why we don\u2019t confuse Adyashanti with Krishnamurti or Rupert. We recognize one from the other because each of their unique, identifiable personalities continues.<br><br>So the question becomes\u2026<br><br>Assuming we\u2019re able (and willing) to see past the hope and myth of getting to something \u201cbetter\u201d \u2026 is it possible to be OK with that?<br><br>Is it possible to set aside all our dreams of a better Me, and stop chasing an idealized fantasy life?<br><br>Byron Katie: <em>\"There is no permanent state of clarity, since clarity has no future. We don't wake up forever. We wake up only now. People have these wonderful experiences of spiritual opening, and that's not it. As soon as they think, \"I want this to last forever,\" they've moved into a future and lost the reality. THIS is it, right now. It's that simple. Only this exists.\"<\/em><br><br>Oh I do wish this for everyone. Because trying to be MORE brings perpetual seeking, perpetual failure, perpetual self-blame, self-focus and lies. &nbsp;<br><br>That\u2019s a failure-ridden, misery-inducing, non-stop feeding of personal inadequacy. Not to mention a drained bank-account, crushed-dreams casualty waiting to happen.<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m not there yet.\u201d<br><br>Well of course you are. There is no \u201cthere,\u201d and every one of us is here. Where else can you be?<br><br>This is it. This Me. Right here. Here it is, and tag, you are already it. There\u2019s nothing more to get.<br><br>Of course we\u2019ve heard and read that many times before, here in The Mind-Tickler and everywhere else.<br><br>Tony Parsons: <em>\"The most effective way the mind AVOIDS Awakening is to SEEK it. &nbsp;You are already that which is. But your mind is frightened to let go and still has an idea that something special should happen.\"<\/em><br><br>But the pull of myth and dream is strong.<br><br>So if we are lucky enough to finally see this\u2026 what now?<br><br>What happens to life when it isn\u2019t chock full of improving, or watching to see what self shouldn\u2019t be doing, or constantly checking to see what is lacking?<br><br>Is it possible to live life without trying to change, attain, correct or fix?<br><br>What does it even look like when relationships hit all the triggers, when things feel utterly sad, when anxiety shows up in the night, if it\u2019s actually understood that this existence, as it is, is it?<br><br>Tim Freke: <em>\u201cMy life isn\u2019t always perfect; it\u2019s full of highs and lows, just as I suspect your life is. We share the same dilemmas. \u2026 I\u2019ve fallen in love with my tender, vulnerable, wounded humanity, just as it is, in all its glorious ambiguity. I\u2019ve fallen in love with my wonderful, terrifying, everyday life, in all its bittersweet splendour.\u201d<\/em><br><br>And yes, dreaming and pining for something better is also \u2018it\u201d, and of course be my guest. Though it does kind of suck.<br><br>But even more than the inevitable unhappiness, myth-chasing actually keeps us from what we\u2019re seeking.<br><br>Because when we simply notice that \u2018bettering\u2019 is going on- not as a ploy to change it, but just noticing the myth at work- something happens.<br><br>Right behind that first disbelieving response- y\u2019know, the tantrum: \u201cNo! This can\u2019t be it! It\u2019s not ok as is! Not even close! Then what\u2019s the point? Why get out of bed? Noooooo\u2026.\u201d<br><br>Right behind that might be, surprisingly\u2026 something else. Something that\u2019s not dependent on fixing things in order to be happy.<br><br>Something now. Something here. Something this.<br><br>Jeff Foster: <em>\u201cNothing changes [after enlightenment.] &nbsp;Eat, shit, grow old. Get cancer. Scream in pain in the middle of the night. None of that stops. This isn't about living in some New Age fantasy world. This isn't about taking on comforting concepts. This is reality at its most raw. Nothing can be blocked out anymore. It's the end of control. It's a love affair with what is.\u201d<\/em><br><br>That's a not-mythological presence which, astonishingly, might just be what we\u2019ve been chasing all along.<br><br>Here already.<br><br>Just like they\u2019ve been saying.<br><br><br><br>","extra":""}
