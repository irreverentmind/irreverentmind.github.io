Once again I am gathering info to help make decisions for next steps (little pun there, har har.)<br><br>The doctors dramatically disagree on what surgery will be right for me.<br><br>So it is up to me\u2026 me, the one with zero medical training or expertise in this field\u2026<br><br>to choose who can help so that I can be done with this situation.<br><br>A lot rides on my making the right choice. But I have no idea how to do that.<br><br>So I\u2019m forced to depend on factors like if the doctor has a good background, and good reviews, and do they seem like they know what they\u2019re doing, do they seem trustworthy?<br><br>Though background, reviews and seems-likes are not what does actual surgery. And none of that tells me which of them is right.<br><br>Which is why I understand as I watch a new friend navigate the spiritual scene.<br><br>He\u2019s been following&nbsp;Sadhguru, Osho, Ramana, Ravi Shankar. He knows of Rupert, and Nisargadatta, and Krishnamurti.<br><br>These people are famous, known all over the world, with books, reverent quotes, and podcasts. So naturally my friend considers them authorities.<br><br>Though if we think about it,&nbsp;what has to happen for that level of fame to happen? How much marketing, hustling, getting the word out? A lot of promotion of the personality has to be done in order to achieve big fame.<br><br>Still, my friend wants truth too, and these people claim to have it.<br><br>So he\u2019s terribly confused.<br><br>Because while the many wise ones often use similar words (such as \u201cSelf\u201d,) they seem to mean very different things.<br><br>And quite often they completely contradict each other.<br><br>Maybe they mean the same thing, but the language makes it confusing.<br><br>Or maybe they&nbsp;don't&nbsp;mean the same thing.<br><br>In which case, enlightenment \u2013 what it is, how to get it, how you know it, what the results are- is a matter of opinion.<br><br>And opinions are not truth.<br><br>Opinions, as many of us know, are like a**holes; everyone\u2019s got one.<br><br>And yet, crazily, who is it up to, to determine whose opinion makes the most sense?<br><br>Well that would be the seeker- the one who is looking to supposed experts for guidance- to figure out who\u2019s right.<br><br>Brilliant set up. Let\u2019s leave it up to folks who are trying to learn something, to figure out which teacher to trust, based on\u2026 well, nothing useful.<br><br>And of course, no one is helping my friend see his blocks to clarity, either.<br><br>Because it doesn\u2019t serve anyone\u2019s purposes for him to see it.<br><br>Every answer to every question drags him deeper into gobbledegook.<br><br>Hello confusion, depression, personal failure, and anxiety.<br><br>All in the name of enlightenment seeking.<br><br>Great!<br><br>So does this mean no one should turn to anyone else to help them learn something new? Does it mean no one should ever get new ideas from any outside source,&nbsp;read anything, listen to any podcast?<br><br>How does anyone know whom to&nbsp;trust and follow?<br><br>Well of course I\u2019m not famous, I\u2019m nobody, and what do I know? But unsurprisingly, I do have an opinion (aka a**hole) about this.<br><br>And hey, my opinion is worth as much as anyone else\u2019s.<br><br>So I would say to my friend and to any lovely Mind-Tickler readers who might also be having a similar experience, if you want outside guidance to help with new input and new ideas, fine. Pick a teacher.<br><br>But just one.<br><br>Not every single \u201cauthority\u201d who happens to have access to a microphone and a publisher.<br><br>Just so that you don\u2019t end up with whiplash.<br><br>Choose someone whom you understand.<br><br>Choose someone who doesn\u2019t require unending financial deposits in order to get access to that great wisdom.<br><br>Most important, choose someone who doesn\u2019t leave you feeling like a failure. Check how do you feel.<br><br>If after the initial lovely&nbsp;AAHHH&nbsp;wears off, you feel bad about yourself, then&nbsp;not that one.<br><br>Choose your personal peace.<br><br>May as well. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s an actual right answer.<br><br>Because truth is movable, variable, and dependent on point of view.<br><br>So no teacher&nbsp;is right.&nbsp;Whomever you turn to is just as good as the next guy.<br><br>And if you\u2019re concerned that if you choose wrong, then you\u2019ll miss out, allow me to help you with that.<br><br>Yes, you will indeed miss out.<br><br>You will miss out on someone else\u2019s ideas, someone else\u2019s choices, someone else\u2019s truth, someone else\u2019s life.<br><br>You\u2019ll miss out on pain and self hatred and failure.<br><br>What you will not miss out on is your&nbsp;own&nbsp;life, your own experience, your own wisdom.<br><br>Besides, really, no one needs enlightenment.<br><br>No one.<br><br>No one needs feet either.<br><br>And that is the great liberating, exhilarating, truth<br><br>Which no podcast or guru or foot surgeon<br><br>can, or will,<br><br>ever provide.<br><br><em><br>\u201cYou are rewarding a teacher poorly if you remain always a pupil.\u201d <br>--Nietzsche<\/em><br><br><strong><br><em><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to get your Mind-Tickled via email every week.<\/a><\/em><em>&nbsp;<\/em><br><em><br><\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yjGT9pciLDw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Watch Judy and Shiv Sengupta discuss spiritual anarchy<\/em><\/a><br><em><br><\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MnxlpQC2PBU&t=6s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Click here to watch Judy on Buddha at the Gas Pump&nbsp;<\/em><\/a><em><br><br><\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7RTsMwHqu3Q\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>click to watch Judy and Walter have fun chatting&nbsp;<\/em><\/a><em>about about nonduality, the self, consciousness, awareness, free willand other light and breezy stuff<br><br>watch Judy and Robert Saltzman talk nonduality<\/em><br><em>1-&nbsp;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BAa3UCEyROQ<\/em><br><\/strong><em><strong>2- https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7fv_vsvaejshttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3DAn8Rqg3I0<\/strong><\/em>","extra":"","extra2":""}
