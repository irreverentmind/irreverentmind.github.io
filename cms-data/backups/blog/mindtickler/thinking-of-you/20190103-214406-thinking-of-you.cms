Another frets that her family thinks she\u2019s a bad mother. This one is certain people think she\u2019s a loser, and another wonders what people would think if they knew about her sexual fantasies.<br><br>Humans want other humans to think well of us. We want parents to love us, bosses to respect us, partners to find us attractive. We want admiration, appreciation and approval.<br><br>Lots of it.<br><br>Of course not from everyone. But from someone or group of someones?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Now this pervasive obsession may sometimes be subtle. And perhaps this is where some Mind-Tickler readers may break into that ol' familiar song about how they don\u2019t give a f**k what anybody thinks.<br><br>All while making sure to say and post and insist that they don\u2019t care.<br><br>Because they want us to know they don\u2019t care.<br><br>Because they care what we think.<br><br>The dirty truth is that everyone cares what at least some people think.<br><br>Well, about themselves, anyway.<br><br>\u201cWhat will people think? About MEEEEEE.\u201d<br><br>Are you thinking about ME? No? Well whatever is interfering with that important business, stop it right now and come back to what matters.<br><br>Me.<br><br>Let\u2019s focus on Me. What do you think about Me? Do you like Me? Do you think I\u2019m great? Do you think I\u2019m crap? Well f*ck you then. Wait, you don\u2019t love Me? Why not, what\u2019s wrong with Me? Can I fix Me so you think I\u2019m great? Can I fix you so you think I\u2019m great?<br><br>Anyone notice that all thinking comes back to being about the Me, in one form or another?<br><br>Kids failing school? Oh no, I\u2019m a bad parent. Running out of money? I\u2019m a loser. Getting fat? I\u2019m unlovable. Love music? Dude I am so cool. Global warming? Powerless doomed me and mine.<br><br>Like a boomerang. Every thought. Every time. Back to Me.<br><br>What that does is continually and effectively serve to hide that we\u2019re not what we think we are.<br><br>And that no one else is, either.<br><br>Which is why there\u2019s only one reason anyone gives a crap what people think.<br><br>And that\u2019s to bolster this Me idea and keep it front and center. Let's keep all thought pointed right here, all the time, so that it feels like a real thing. &nbsp;<br><br>Turns out, thousands of years of human concern about other peoples' thoughts has simply been selfing, keeping the veil closed, trying to pull off the ruse.<br><br>\u201cAm I fooling them? Do they buy it?\u201d &nbsp;<br><br>This provides a solid sense of self.<br><br>Which is not to be confused with an<em>&nbsp;actual&nbsp;<\/em>self.<br><br>Caring what people think is a strategy for pretending the mask is real, and for projecting and protecting... an image. &nbsp;<br><br>Even though images don\u2019t need protecting and don't care a whit about thought.<br><br>And even though whatever is behind the mask doesn't care whether thoughts say the \"right\" things, or not.<br><br>Whew. No wonder many of us are so tired.<br><br>\u201cLook! Everyone\u2019s pointing at me and thinking about me! That must mean I'm here! Yay! Keep it going!\u201d<br><br>This locates us. It\u2019s GPS for the story of self. &nbsp;<br><br>Because what real thing would even want to be the center of all that unrelenting attention anyway?<br><br>So yes, thought may appear to define us and tell us we\u2019re good or bad or kind or bitchy.<br><br>But what cares?<br><br>And what needs all that identity, location, and I\u2019m-right-here-ness?<br><br>And what sends out that constant wordy blah blah rumination and Me-focus?<br><br>Nothing, honey.<br><br>Nothing at all.<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\">Click to get in on the Mind-Tickler every week<\/a>","extra":""}
