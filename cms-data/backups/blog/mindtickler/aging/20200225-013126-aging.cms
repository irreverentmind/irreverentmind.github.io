Look at you. That body is deteriorating as we speak.<br><br>Whether you are 7 or 22 or 58 or 88, you're inexorably marching towards death.<br><br>It could happen at any moment. No matter how well the rules for health are followed, or if you smoke or eat the chip or lie like a sloth on the couch.<br><br>We all know this. Kind of.<br><br>Still we like to pretend \u201cgetting older\u201d hasn\u2019t been happening since our birth. We pretend that it takes a while and then oldness hits all of a sudden- 40? 50? and Bam! Moisturizer. Sensible shoes. Posture exercises. Sweatpants.<br><br>Not to mention lack of sexual attractiveness, and invisibility. Because let\u2019s face it, we\u2019ve relied for years on the supposed value of being seen and wanted. Value we've taken credit for, but actually have nothing to do with. I mean, whose doing is it if we are graced with beauty, or if others \u201cwant\u201d us?<br><br>Not us.<br><br>And then along comes a day when we have to find some other tool to manipulate others to see these selves in a way we like.<br><br>Aging is a challenge to the story of who and what we are, a challenge to the image of the me.<br><br>Turns out that, rather than the body, it\u2019s actually the carefully crafted identity that demands our attention and intervention.<br><br>Which we hate.<br><br>And which is why, once we cross that arbitrary and varies-by-person number-threshold, aging is suddenly something we have to figure out how to <em>deal with<\/em>. &nbsp;We have to <em>come to terms&nbsp;<\/em>with it.<br><br>Because y\u2019know, life hadn\u2019t been doing just fine without us dealing with aging so far. And of course existence needs us to be ok with, and needs our little brains to understand how, it does its job.<br><br>Making us vitally important.<br><br>Now <em>that,<\/em> we love. Enough to make it worth the discomfort of fretting about aging.<br><br>So we pretend that we control longevity. Just do things right- eat the kale, do the 5k, drink the spirulina kombucha- and we\u2019re promised the certainty of extended duration. &nbsp;<br><br>And if not, welcome to dying prematurely.<br><br>Though... &nbsp;\"premature\" according to whose timetable?<br><br>Meanwhile, to further confirm human's power over existence, let's mix in the requirement to live this life \u201cto the fullest.\u201d &nbsp;<br><br>Whatever the hell that is.<br><br>Oh the pressure to make the most of this one wild and precious life.<br><br>As if a simple, \u201cHey look I\u2019m alive!\u201d isn\u2019t near enough. No, let\u2019s get busy <em>getting the mos<\/em>t out of it, for the longest possible amount of time.<br><br>Because humans aren\u2019t greedy at <em>all.<\/em><br><br>Although\u2026. if we knew we were dying tonight at 5pm, would we care about making the most of life?<br><br>With no time for big fat notable experiences, that sun on the chair might have to do. A nap. Typing an email. Sitting in a work conference. Packing boxes in a warehouse.<br><br>The mundane simplicity of <em>breathe in<\/em> and<em>&nbsp;breathe out<\/em> would be all we\u2019d get.<br><br>Because no living creature is owed a grand experience.<br><br>So we might consider enjoying the crap out of whatever\u2019s here, instead of aiming for <em>better<\/em>, or demanding <em>more<\/em>, or taking ownership of what is clearly not ours.<br><br>Because it just might be that <em>getting the most out of life<\/em> actually means experiencing the enormity of...<br><br>the least of it.<br><br>Which happily might be more than enough. No matter what the age number involved.<br><br>So maybe there\u2019s no need to try to hoard life.<br><br>Especially since holding onto life, like holding one\u2019s breath, is a sure way to kill it.<br><br>So we breathe. Sleep. Feel. Drink. Eat.<br><br>Living <em>this.<\/em> As it is. In all its configurations.<br><br>It doesn\u2019t age.<br><br>It\u2019s as present, as <em>now,<\/em> as could be.<br><br>As is this body.<br><br>Until\u2026<br><br>Next.<br><em><br><\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Click here to get your Mind-Tickled&nbsp;<\/em><\/a><em>every week.<\/em><br><br><br><em><img align=\"center\" alt=\"\" src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/1582594212529.jpg\" width=\"155\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\"><\/em><br><em><br><\/em>","extra":""}
