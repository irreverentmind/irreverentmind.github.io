Although we pretend, we really shouldn\u2019t forget that we are pretending, that we are making up the content of our experience; we are making up the little dramas of our lives.\"<br>--Adyashanti<\/em><br><br>----------<br><br>Occasionally a client accuses me of invalidating them.<br><br>To be fair, usually I\u2019m thinking, \u201cYay!\u201d when that happens.<br><br>Because yes, hopefully so.<br><br>But no, they don't like it. They want to be validated, not invalidated.<br><br>As most likely you do too.<br><br>Validate: To confirm, endorse, establish, legitimize. To make valid. (Merriam Webster)<br><br>As in, not valid already, and needs to be made valid.<br><br>Suffering, panic, tears, the trauma that has sucked up huge amounts of time trying to get over- that\u2019s what is supposed to be validated.<br><br>Y\u2019know, by moi, and others.<br><br>Because you can\u2019t make yourself valid, right? It requires someone outside, somehow,<br><br>to legitimize feelings you yourself hate and desperately want to go away.<br><br>I\u2019m just not quite clear why anybody would want that.<br><br>I\u2019m also not clear about how this works, exactly.<br><br>I mean, would a sympathetic, \u201cThere, there, honey,\u201d legitimize a person or feeling? \u201cI understand your pain? I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re hurting?\u201d- would that do it?<br><br>Do what, exactly?<br><br>Provide a warm and fuzzy feeling for a bit? What wants or needs that?<br><br>Besides, what do those handful of words above actually make valid?&nbsp;Feelings? Story? Past trauma? Self? How is confirming any of that, desirable?<br><br>Seems something much prefers to hold onto crappy feelings, verifying and validating of them, than to&nbsp;risk losing them.<br><br>Ah yes. Of course.<br><br>The self hates being invalidated.<br><br>After all, invalidate it now and the next thing you know, it&nbsp;might be seen to be&nbsp;not there at all.<br><br>Which is not ok.<br><br>Well, to the non-existent self, anyway.<br><br>Better to confirm that sucker. Better to make a precious space for it with soothing words, lots of hugs, and a generous supply of tissues.<br><br>Better to validate it.<br><br>Because validation holds the sense of self in place. Validation equals confirmation. Confirmed selves feels real. Real is greatly preferred to not-real, when it comes to the sense of self.<br><br>Now that's&nbsp;something you can like.<br><br>It\u2019s just that it\u2019s never enough.<br><br>I mean, if, \u201cI feel your pain\u201d actually succeeded in achieving true contentment, then your friendly Mind-Tickler would be whole-heartedly saying those words nonstop.<br><br>Instead it\u2019s unending therapy and inquiry and sitting with feelings and embodiment and group connectivity classes.<br><br>Because the self, whatever it is, has never been satisfied with any amount of validation it has managed to get.<br><br>The longing for endorsement has been pretty much bottomless. It feels&nbsp;nice for a while, and then soon enough you want more again.<br><br>Which makes sense. After all,&nbsp;no corroboration can ever make what's&nbsp;not-there, there.<br><br>So maybe the next time someone appears to invalidate you, maybe just for fun, for curiosity, for novelty,<br><br>you might check to see if what you need in that moment is actually validation.<br><br>Even if it feels strongly like you want it.<br><br>Because it could turn out that no one ever&nbsp;needs validation of fairy tales.<br><br>It could turn out that you feel much better not&nbsp;holding so tightly to that validated self.<br><br>And it could turn out that you get more of what you actually want<br><br>By invalidating validation.<br><br>Perhaps more than any, \u201cThere there honey, I feel your pain\u201d<br><br>And box of tissues<br><br>will ever provide.<br><br>","extra":"","extra2":""}
