Old 70s TV shows, mortifying moments from grade school. It was really going through some dusty old mental files, just jumping up and down to reclaim focus. My brain is basically a toddler in the grocery store. Mom, mom, mommy, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mother, moooooom.\u201d<br>\u2013Comment on Facebook<br><br><br>Last week on Facebook, I jumped on a viral trend and asked, \u201cMale friends specifically- how often do you think about the Roman Empire?\u201d<br><br>Seeing that post, you may have thought, \u201cEt tu, Judy?\u201d<br><br>After all, here at the Mind-Tickler Forum, the usual conversation is about self, mind, consciousness, reality, free will, feelings. Why waste this week\u2019s Tickler on the Roman Empire, of all things?<br><br>Besides, why is it even a trend to ask men if they think about the Roman Empire in the first place?<br><br>Well, rarely do we ask people to expose what they think about on a regular basis.<br><br>So when we do ask, apparently it's fascinating to discover that others have different thoughts than we do.<br><br>Not to&nbsp;mention, how else could it have been discovered that gladiators, aquaducts, emperors, the width of train tracks, and the state of empires fill&nbsp;the minds of many thousands of folks, daily, weekly, monthly.**<br><br>Wait.<em>&nbsp;Fills the minds<\/em>, you say?<br><br>Well yes. Because whether it\u2019s Romans or Greeks or Vikings or World&nbsp;War II or Mayans\u2026<br><br>or whether it\u2019s enlightenment, reality, awareness, consciousness\u2026<br><br>or whether it\u2019s when the next drink is coming&nbsp;or if we&nbsp;should have made that golf shot&nbsp;or what\u2019s happening on our phone\u2026<br><br>even if it\u2019s just an annoying song stuck in our head\u2026<br><br>thinking is happening.<br><br>Even meditators who think they slow or stop thoughts, still have to think in order to know what those thoughts are doing.<br><br>Fast or slow, the mind must be filled.<br><br>The subject matter it is filled with?<br><br>Irrelevant.<br><br>Any topic will do.<br><br>Ruminating about the Roman Empire works equally as well as having a song stuck in the head.<br><br>Mind, happily filled with busy-work.<br><br>And then as an extra bonus, all that thinking creates identity.<br><br>We know who and what we are, based on the particular stories focused on.<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m the one who thinks about important subjects such as Roman history, or awareness, or free will.\u201d<br><br>Thinking convinces us that we\u2019re a person.<br><br>\u201cHere I am, thinking about modern politics compared to the fall of the Roman Empire.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHere I am, stopping my thoughts, attaining equanimity, connecting with higher consciousness.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHere I am, feeling, and then thinking about that feeling.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHere I am, reviewing how I handled that game, that meeting, that social occasion, that relationship.\u201d<br><br>Here I am. Right here.<br><br>A person. Of \u201csubstance.\u201d<br><br>Rumination on any topic provides that supposed substance.<br><br>Self. Identified by thoughts.<br><br>Never mind that thoughts contain no substance themselves.<br><br>They're nothing.<br><br>So when the self depends on that nothing in order to prove its existence, well, that\u2019s an odd kind of real.<br><br>Meanwhile, in all the focus on thinking's&nbsp;subject matter, what usually goes unnoticed is the repetition.<br><br>It's always the same subjects and the same thoughts showing up&nbsp;for each individual.<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m alone.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not good enough.\u201d \u201cI need to understand no-self.\u201d \u201cThe Roman Empire was important.\u201d<br><br>Over and over and over and over.<br><br>Because thinking is not original, not creative.<br><br>At all.<br><br>It learns something and then hangs on to bits of that learning, for a lifetime.<br><br>Repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating.<br><br>Practicing. Making sure its favorite stories show up frequently enough to become, and then remain, rote, natural, effortless.<br><br>Exactly the same way a child learns language.<br><br>Blah blah Roman Empire blah blah ME blah Unmotivated blah Full Potential blah Unlovable blah Something Wrong blah Enlightened blah&nbsp;Was Marcus Aurelius a good Emperor.<br><br>Mind, practicing repetitious strings of words.<br><br>Regurgitating, like Romans in the vomitorium, the same stuff all day every day.<br><br>In order to convince us we are real and separate.<br><br>After all, thought says so.<br><br>Even though it is nothing, talking about nothing, describing nothing, using words which are nothing.<br><br>And therefore, proving nothing.<br><br>Still, all roads lead to Rome.<br><br>Thought has to think.<br><br>One thought is as good as the next.<br><br>It doesn\u2019t matter what they\u2019re about.<br><br>It doesn\u2019t even matter if there\u2019s a person thinking them.<br><br>Thumbs up or thumbs down,<br><br>It\u2019s all the same<br><br>substance.<br><br>** (if you're in the mood for a laugh, watch till the end.)<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@ambarrail\/video\/7278682791531908398?_r=1&_t=8fnSA5pEbao\">https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@ambarrail\/video\/7278682791531908398?_r=1&amp;_t=8fnSA5pEbao<\/a><br><br><br><img align=\"center\" alt=\"\" src=\"\/cms-data\/gallery\/hipwig\/1696535976573.jpg\" width=\"287.12\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\"><br>","extra":"","extra2":""}
