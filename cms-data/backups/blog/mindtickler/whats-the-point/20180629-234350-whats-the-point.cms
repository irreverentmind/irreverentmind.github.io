I\u2019d be writing the Mind-Tickler from my yacht right now. <br><br>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point? I need a purpose. Why get out of bed?\u201d<br><br>Seems many many folks are dedicated to the idea that humans need a point in order to have a worthwhile life.<br><br>Even though if we actually consider, we can see that that idea is incorrect and actually makes life miserable and feel less worthwhile.<br><br>I mean, think about it. What other creature needs a purpose? Do mosquitoes need a purpose? Cats, toads, scorpions, raccoons?<br><br>Nah.<br><br>While it\u2019s enough for every other creature to simply exist, for humans, it\u2019s, \u201cNo no no, I need more than mere existence. I need a POINT.\u201d<br><br>Only humans think we\u2019re so important that we require more than just being alive.<br><br>Although really\u2026 what for?<br><br>Seriously.<br><br>It\u2019s not like purpose brings us peace.<br><br>On the contrary.<br><br>Rather than the beautiful meaningful life that thought insists will come because we have a purpose, in actuality we get stress, striving, dissatisfaction, failure and inadequacy.<br><br>Mmmm, gimme some more of that.<br><br>Have you noticed the misery in reaching for meaning, the striving and un-peace of having to have a point or purpose?<br><br>\u201cGet up, get going! Do something! You have a purpose, something to make happen! Stop sitting on your lazy ass and get moving!\u201d<br><br>Sure. Peaceful.<br><br>But maybe that vague sense of lacking something, missing something, is the point of needing a point.<br><br>Can you see how need-for-purpose keeps the focus single-mindedly on self, problem solving, goal attaining, here-is-not-enough-ness?<br><br>Dissatisfied. Lacking. Forever.<br><br>That doesn\u2019t seem right, does it?<br><br>Maybe we\u2019ve had this wrong.<br><br>Even though it seems to be, even though it feels like it should be\u2026 maybe existence is not really about anything at all.<br><br>Because you can see that life is not important, right?<br><br>All shapes, sizes, webbings, claws, fingernails, number of toes. Ebbing and flowing. Coming and going.<br><br>No biggie. &nbsp;Not important.<br><br>So can you feel how simple life could be, how pure, how lovely a collection of varied and color-filled experiences, if it could be lived without\u2026 requirement?<br><br>Y\u2019know, just for the livingness of it?<br><br>It could be that, free of point-obligation, we might be able to just\u2026 exist... for a while.<br><br>Free. Living.<br><br>Just because we ARE.<br><br>Wouldn\u2019t that be something?<br><br>All of us on this earth- every living creature- experiencing.<br><br>Just cuz.<br><br>As if the point to living is just the living of it.<br><br>As in, there is no point.<br><br>Just alive. For now.<br><br>There's a point for ya.<br><br>Living. Experiencing. &nbsp;Anything. Everything.<br><br>Joy, love, misery, shame, suffering, boredom, ecstasy.<br><br>And then\u2026<br><br>Next.<br><br>No purpose, no point, no lesson, no growth, no meaning.<br><br>Because those are simply concepts. And concepts are a whole bunch of nothing.<br><br>So why get out of bed in the morning?<br><br>Because we do.<br><br>Because why not.<br><br>Because life happens.<br><br>Silly humans.<br><br><em>\"The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves.\"<br>-- Alan Watts<\/em><br>","extra":""}
