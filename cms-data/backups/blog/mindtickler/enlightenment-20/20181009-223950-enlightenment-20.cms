And then I lost it.\u201d<br><br>In sessions and groups, I hear this over and over.<br><br>Enlightenment is quite the tease it seems.<br><br>It shows up for a while, bringing the requisite peace, the non-reactive contentment, the bliss.<br><br>Oh yeah! We shall say yes to this sweetness. Enlightenment has arrived!<br><br>And so have you, now-enlightened one.<br><br>Until just as suddenly, on its own timetable and without fan-fair, after hanging out a few moments, hours, days, months, it slips off again.<br><br>Hey where\u2019d you go? Adios, enlightenment.<br><br>And then you\u2019re back to the same ol\u2019 judging, dissatisfied, thought-believing life.<br><br>Only now, you have had a tantalizing taste of sugar.<br><br>What person in his right mind wouldn't want to set about trying to get that back?<br><br>Although\u2026. you can see the potential carrot-chasing in this, right?<br><br>There\u2019s a better yum out there; better than everyday fare. You had it for a while. You're hungry for more.<br><br>And what happens to the present, to what is here, when the desire to get back the enlightenment experience runs the show?<br><br>\u201cI know! Let\u2019s trash what is here and pine for \/hope for the return of what isn\u2019t.\u201d<br><br>Dissatisfaction with what we have. Desire for nicer feelings, nicer thoughts, less ego, a moratorium on judgments.<br><br>Just business as usual with a fancier label slapped on it.<br><br>Besides, is enlightenment even supposed to last forever? I mean, I realize that's what all the spiritual mythology says, but could it be that all that spiritual blah blah is (gasp) wrong? Could it be the forever-enlightened life is actually just carrot-nonsense?<br><br>Everything on this planet comes and goes; nothing is permanent. Why should enlightenment be any different?<br><br>Whether you consider awakening a point of view, an experience, an understanding, or a feeling state, why shouldn\u2019t it come and go like everything else?<br><br>And then, isn't there\u2019s that sense that you- with all your study and retreats and satsangs and meditating and extra-special giftedness or whatever- you made awakening show up to begin with?<br><br>Of course then, that also means you failed. Blew it. You made it leave. \u201cI made this happen and I made it un-happen.\"<br><br>Powerful, self-important, all-revolves-around-you You.<br><br>Pretty darned Self centered, no? &nbsp;Lots of \u201cyou-ing\u201d involved.<br><br>Is it logical that the experience of transcending self would somehow simultaneously make self more important, more special?<br><br>Or might such reasoning instead confirm ego, just with a new label?<br><br>Maybe you can see that this makes no sense, and that you simply can't get what you're looking for that way.<br><br>So yeah, had an enlightenment experience and lost it?<br><br>Well, OK.<br><br>Liked or not, this right here\u2026this is What Is.<br><br>Experience comes and go as it pleases.<br><br>And without the idea that scoring \u201cenlightenment\u201d is better...<br><br>It could be that acceptance of the present, with whatever situations, feelings, judgments, behaviors and thoughts show up, is where the experience you\u2019re wishing would come back actually lives.<br><br>Besides, once something is seen it can\u2019t be unseen.<br><br>Which is yet another way of saying, what you seek is already here.<br><br>This experience you\u2019ve got right now is the enlightenment you crave.<br><br>Which means there\u2019s nothing to improve, nothing to change, nothing to get back, nothing to seek.<br><br>That would not be business as usual, would it.<br><br>Who knows, it might even be downright EnLightening.<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\">Click to get in on the Mind-Tickler every week<\/a><br>","extra":""}
