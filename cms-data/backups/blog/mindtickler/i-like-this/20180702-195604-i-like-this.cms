I don\u2019t like this song. Fear- don\u2019t like it. Money- like it. I don\u2019t like all the pain in the world. I like sleep. I like laughing. I don\u2019t like arrogance. I don\u2019t like this heat. Sadness, no. Calm, yes. I like art on the walls. I don\u2019t like her tone. I don\u2019t like wrinkles. I like bare feet. Feeling anxious, don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like the door closed. I prefer black to brown. I don\u2019t like bullying. I like nail polish. I don\u2019t like interruptions. I like shirts un-tucked. I like love, don't like unfairness, hatred, bias\u2026.<br><br>Well. It\u2019s nonstop, isn\u2019t it? It's a lifetime of constant evaluation. \u201cThis- yes! This- noooo.\u201d<br><br>We only want things and feelings we like, to happen.<br><br>We have an opinion about everything. We have an opinion about ANYthing.<br><br>It doesn\u2019t matter how small or insignificant the subject- freckles, length of eyelashes, size of body parts.<br><br>Sometimes we use different words, saying, \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d Or, \u201cThis is good.\u201d We\u2019ll call it opinion or evaluation or judgment. They\u2019re all different words for the same thing.<br><br>It all comes down to, \u201cI like this. I don\u2019t like this.\u201d<br><br>And yet, notice how much pain is caused simply by the thought, \u201cI don\u2019t like this?\u201d<br><br>And the idea that it matters if we like it... well, there's no peace in that.<br><br>So is it actually so all-fired important to like it? And does it matter?<br><br>Does not liking keep things from happening? Does it do anything but cause a frustration tantrum?<br><br>Like, does suffering stop because we disapprove? Does anxiety cease as soon as we determine, \u201cOh this is awful\u201d?<br><br>Isn't it a great big, \"So What,\" all this wing-flapping about preferences?<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t like feeling deficient!\u201d &nbsp;Yes. What now?<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t like suffering!\u201d &nbsp;Yes, absolutely. So?<br><br>\u201cBut I don\u2019t like that you don\u2019t care that I don\u2019t like it!\u201d &nbsp;Got it. So?<br><br>Does it matter one iota whether we like it?<br><br>Funny we haven't noticed that it's irrelevant.<br><br>The mind hates that what we want doesn\u2019t matter. But it\u2019s clear that it doesn\u2019t matter.<br><br>So then what is the benefit of all this futile liking and not liking?<br><br>Well, it is in the preferences that we create the self story. We\u2019re defined by our likes and dislikes.<br><br>The story of who we are- the one who likes blue and doesn\u2019t like eggplant- is literally created via those preferences.<br><br>So it doesn\u2019t matter whether we like hot flashes or chocolate, or what we like, as long as we have a preference.<br><br>We can\u2019t escape it. This is a predominant way the Self story forms.<br><br>It's 'Me\u2019, maintained by yeses and nos.<br><br>That\u2019s why there are so many of them, and why we don\u2019t encounter almost anything that we don\u2019t have a like or dislike about.<br><br>Because the story of self is so ephemeral, so delicate, so fragile, that if liking\/not liking were to let up for one second, well..<br><br>The mind is afraid of what would be left without them.<br><br>And what would happen if it was somehow possible to suddenly not have preferences?<br><br>Would we (as we know us) continue to exist? &nbsp;Would we turn into smoke?<br><br>Poof?<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, Officer. She stopped having preferences and suddenly she was gone!\"<br><br>I mean\u2026.<br><br>So is it necessary to not have likes and dislikes? Is it even possible?<br><br>All those spiritual leaders suggesting that preferences, wants, desires are bad.<br><br>Isn\u2019t that just a different way of saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like having wants?\u201d<br><br>Just more liking and disliking, isn't it?<br><br>So instead of one more thing we're supposed to fix about ourselves, maybe it\u2019s possible to just see all the self-ing going on with all those opinions.<br><br>And leave it at that.<br><br>Because odds are good that we will go to our grave liking or not-liking.<br><br>\u201cSuffering and Deficiency and Wanting- Oh No! I. Do. Not. Like.\u201c<br><br>Yup.<br><br>Ok.<br><br>Next.","extra":""}
