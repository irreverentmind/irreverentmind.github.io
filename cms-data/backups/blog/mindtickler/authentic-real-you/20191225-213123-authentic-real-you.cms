Very well, then I contradict myself.<br>I am large. I contain multitudes.\"<br>--Walt Whitman<\/em><br><br>There\u2019s a lot of instruction and lecturing and certainty out there in self-help-land about authenticity.<br><br>They tell us it\u2019s a good thing to live and express our real, authentic self. They tell us it\u2019s a necessary thing.<br><br>They tell us it\u2019s a possible thing.<br><br>What they rarely tell us is what this highly-desired, \u201creal, authentic self\u201d thing even is.<br><br>Because let\u2019s face it, these Me-things fluctuate. They vary based on context, situation, preference, conditioning.<br><br>So sometimes the individual self is kind and sometimes it\u2019s mean and sometimes it's scared and sometimes it\u2019s aware and sometimes it acts impulsively.<br><br>And no one is the same Me all the time.<br><br>Which means it's a temporary, changeable role.<br><br>So we're play-acting, image-making, giving a presentation.<br><br>That\u2019s what we call \u201cacting like\u201d oneself.<br><br>Not <em>being <\/em>one\u2019s actual self. Acting<em> like<\/em> it.<br><br>Which sounds more like \u201cfake\u201d than any particularly solid <em>real <\/em>to be authentic about.<br><br>I mean, there's no point in being authentic about a fake self.<br><br>And yet even so, we often experience a strong desire to experience congruency between some desire to speak or act, and a feeling in the body- the feeling that somehow seems to indicate, \u201cYou must say this in order to be true to yourself.\u201d<br><br>Even though that\u2019s just a feeling, a sense, or, to call it by its real name\u2026<br><br>A preference.<br><br>This is what authenticity, that highly vaunted state of being which we are supposed to strive for at all times, really comes down to...<br><br>A preference for one feeling over another.<br><br>Because set aside that preference, and we might notice that nothing real ever requires our expression in order to validate itself.<br><br>It\u2019s real already. Human expression adds no additional realness.<br><br>So it needs zero validation. Because, yknow,<em> real<\/em>. Regardless of how we feel.<br><br>It\u2019s already authentic just fine, thank you very much- it don\u2019t need no stinkin' authenticity.<br><br>So authenticity is a meaningless concept whose only purpose is to create a never ending project, something unattainable to strive for.<br><br>And Alan Watts had it right (as usual) when he said we are all, always, genuine fakes.<br><br>Because it's not possible for the false self to ever be authentic.<br><br>Now perhaps you can see what this means.<br><br>It means since all the facets of the Me are pretend, then it\u2019s possible, and we might as well,<br><br>Have fun with them all. &nbsp;<br><br>We can invite every role, even the parts that \u201cfeel like\u201d they\u2019re not authentic, to come and read their scripts. We can put on a puppet show, or a neighborhood skit.<br><br>Whee! I\u2019ll play Judy, the weird nutty friend who never says what anyone expects.<br><br>At least for today.<br><br>Who do <em>y<\/em><em>ou<\/em> want to be? &nbsp;Let\u2019s invite them all!<br><br>Bring on smiling self, deceptive self, bored self, angry self, sad self, laughing self. Bring on loving self, aware-and-blissed-out self, and completely-reactive-don\u2019t-get-it self, too.<br><br>None of them are an unchangeable real Me. So none have to ever be any different.<br><br>And none require us to be true and authentic to any of them.<br><br>Meanwhile, whatever it is that <em>contains<\/em> all the variability making up these individuals\u2026<br><br><em>That<\/em> is not itself variable.<br><br><em>That<\/em> is always its authentic, real, true self.<br><br>Already. &nbsp;<br><br>No human striving necessary.<br><br>And it contains\u2026<br><br>Multitudes. &nbsp;<br><br>So go on.
