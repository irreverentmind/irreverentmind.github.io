It\u2019s not inside.<br><br>Want inner peace? Not in there either.","words":674,"content":"Somewhere deep inside us, in there along with the blood and muscles and nerves- is a cave-like closet.<br><br>Thoughts are stored in there, as well as a body-less voice spoken by no one which spews mean unwelcome chatter all day long. Peace is in there too, along with Answers.<br><br>Lower down there\u2019s a second closet or an extension of the higher one, where feelings are stashed. Apparently they\u2019re trapped and need help getting out.<br><br>It\u2019s all very rich and dark and potent. Kind of like a tropical jungle, but indoors.<br><br>You know what else is in there? The past. Stealthily running lives, determining what happens everywhere, lying in wait from childhood on to spring forth its demons at all kinds of inconvenient times forever and ever into the future.<br><br>Yup. One hell of a closet.<br><br>Everyone knows this and agrees it\u2019s important to turn inward, go deep, do inner work.<br><br>We just have to be an intrepid adventurer to go on in there, and we\u2019ll find that closet. &nbsp;<br><br>No boat or map or GPS needed. Just ask and answer some questions, visualize, say \u201cOm\u201d a lot, or pray.<br><br>Ready? Let\u2019s go.<br><br>When we do find the closet, inside we\u2019ll find \u201cthe Real Me.\u201d It lives in there, chilling in the dark, listening to the voice, watching the movies, waiting to be found and validated and seen.<br><br>Meanwhile, something that is NOT the Real Me knows about this inner place, makes the trip inside, hears the voice.<br><br>That traveller-to-the-inside is also called \u2018Me\u2019.<br><br>Wait, there are two of them? Which is the Real and which isn\u2019t?<br><br>Oh well, never mind. Onward.<br><br>Somehow the inner one creates the outer world, outside the closet.<br><br>Yet it\u2019s the outside one that has the power to look for, uncover, unlock, examine, shift, transform and\/or free the Real Thing that\u2019s stored inside there. &nbsp;<br><br>Ok. So um\u2026.<br><br>What?<br><br>This is a whole bunch of fantastical magic we've been accepting without question all these years, isn\u2019t it?<br><br>This concept of \u201cgoing inward\u201d makes zero sense.<br><br>Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with believing fairy stories. But clever Mind-Tickler readers have perhaps already noticed all the preoccupation, time, money, inquiry, therapy, satsang and meditation that has been devoted to looking for something\u2026<br><br>that isn\u2019t located where we\u2019re looking.<br><br>And yes perhaps we do get to feel like we\u2019re doing something useful, and that we have control over something. And yes the sense of Me is strong when we pretend it has an inside- one we can access whenever we want, or when we do things just right.<br><br>Still, if the whole point of going inward is to discover the real, to discover the truth, to shift or enlighten\u2026<br><br>We\u2019re not going to find what we claim to want.<br><br>Because fantasy, however engaging, is still fantasy. Fantasy will never be Real. Fiction is fiction.<br><br>So\u2026 want enlightenment? It\u2019s not inside.<br><br>Want inner peace? Not in there either.<br><br>The real me? &nbsp;Nope.<br><br>Because there is no inside.<br><br>There\u2019s no there there.<br><br>That inside job is not inside, not a job, and just plain isn\u2019t.<br><br>Whew. Suddenly so much free time.<br><br>And who knows? When we\u2019re not looking in the wrong direction, we might be more able to notice an already-present vastness, an inconceivable spaciousness\u2026<br><br>which could never be contained or trapped by some small, conceived... inside.<br><br>Whoa.<br><br>Isn\u2019t that what we were looking for all along?<br><br>Oh look.<br><br>Here it is.<br><br>","extra":""}
