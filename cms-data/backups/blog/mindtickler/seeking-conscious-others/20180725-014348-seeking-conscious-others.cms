They yearn for others who think about the same things. They wish for companions who see things the same way. Without like-minded others they feel lonely, disconnected, and separate from non-awake others.<br><br>Irony, anyone?<br><br>And it's not like it's so easy to connect with the right kind of others. Scan through some of the Consciousness groups on Facebook and watch a few zillion takes on Truth show up. There are inquirers and shamans and crystal lovers and manifesters and Advaitans and Buddhists and positive thinkers and sit-with-feelings-ers and scholarly readers and disciplined orange-robed meditating this-is-the-only-way-ers.<br><br>Ever try to truly connect with someone whose version of spirituality is different from yours?<br><br>Yeah, that\u2019s not any less alone, is it?<br><br>So people gather into \u201cschools of thought.\u201d Kind of like the Sorting Hat at Hogwarts.<br><br>But ... this doesn\u2019t make sense. How can connectedness only be possible when there are shared interests? That\u2019s not very connected, is it?<br><br>It\u2019s starting to appear that people might be using apparent common interest in consciousness to define \u2026 themselves. &nbsp;Y'know, as individuals.<br><br>Separating the world into, \u201cYou\u2019re in,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re out.\u201d<br><br>Which kind of contradicts that little enlightened idea of no separation, no?<br><br>Not to mention those many consciousness explorers who've come to think that having that interest makes them special in some way. Superior, almost. Y\u2019know, a few steps above those poor stuck non-awake non-spiritual types.<br><br>Hey, no ego in that, right? No separation, individualization, identity there.<br><br>\u2018Course not.<br><br>Just looked at logically, it's pretty clear that if awakening is what is sought, it's not going to be found in the divided Us-Them teams of conscious people vs not-conscious people.<br><br>In fact it\u2019s very possible that the thought, \u201cI need people around me who think the same as I do,\u201d actually creates the sense of isolation, rather than being its result.<br><br>Maybe \u201clike-minded\u201d is not only unnecessary, it\u2019s an interference. &nbsp;<br><br>When we sort people into Who\u2019s With Me and Who\u2019s Not, we end up focusing on thought, narrowing perception, and missing other, non-thought forms of communion.<br><br>Because whatever it is we really are, (whether it's named consciousness or God or universe or spirit or soul)\u2026<br><br>Maybe it doesn\u2019t need one human\u2019s words to match another human\u2019s words.<br><br>Maybe it doesn't need agreement.<br><br>Maybe it doesn\u2019t need words, thoughts or points of view at all.<br><br>Besides, whatever that is, this What-We-Really-Are thing, where does it end, and the What-The-Other-Guy-Really-Is thing, begin?<br><br>If we cant find that divider, it could be because there isn\u2019t one.<br><br>In which case, we\u2019re already connected and there\u2019s nothing separating us.<br><br>No matter what thought says, no matter whether there's agreement, no matter whether thoughts are about consciousness or beer or camels.<br><br>Which would mean we\u2019re equally as connected to a NASCAR fan or a Trump supporter or a religious zealot as we are to an Enlightened Sage.<br><br>Perhaps that\u2019s shocking.<br><br>But only if we\u2019re focused on thoughts.<br><br>Move attention away from the selective sorting into agree-disagree groupings, and we begin to see that \u201calone and disconnected\u201d isn\u2019t possible. &nbsp;<br><br>Regardless of our viewpoints on consciousness, enlightenment, and those Others.<br><br>Which is pretty sweet.<br><br>And connected.<br><br>And anything but alone.<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\">Click to get in on the Mind-Tickler every week<\/a><br>","extra":""}
