Well, I guess \u201ckilled himself\u201d is more accurate.<br><br>Not because he was depressed, or sick, or in pain- he wasn't. He had a perfectly fine and adequate life.<br><br>So then why take this very calm and methodical action?<br><br>Because at age 85, my dad felt he had nothing more to \u201clook forward to.\u201d<br><br>He saw that the present was all that was left. &nbsp;He saw, \u201cThere is no point.\u201d &nbsp;He saw, \u201cThis is it.\u201d &nbsp;<br><br>And he did not like it.<br><br>So he left.<br><br>That\u2019s what our typical future-driven, improvement oriented, focus on situations can bring a person to.<br><br>A great big fat no-thanks to existence as it is.<br><br>The fact is, for most folks, the present- unchanged, unfixed, unsmoothed- is simply not enough.<br><br>Which is why so many lifetimes are devoted to more, to getting, to improving. We're aiming for the future, striving for goals, trying to attain.<br><br>We want better health, we want good things for the kids, we want love, a better job, more sleep. We want a different story of ourselves, to be enlightened, to get unstressful thoughts, or more space between thoughts, or no thoughts at all. We want happier feelings and to be a better person (whatever any of that actually means.)<br><br>And then we spend these lives try, try, trying to make all that happen.<br><br>Until old age finally brings home the pointlessness of shooing away existence as it is.<br><br>With old age we discover that we can no longer pretend there\u2019s more more coming. We\u2019re forced to come reluctantly face-to-face with this is it.<br><br>And yes, some find that sad or depressing. Certainly many reject this What Is business right up to the bitter end.<br><br>In fact my dad\u2019s seemingly dramatic choice was really just a version of, \"Screw this \"presence\" stuff. Give me something better to at least aim for or I'm taking my ball and leaving.\"<br><br>So today, just because that's what we do here, The Mind-Tickler asks\u2026<br><br>Is it possible to enjoy this lifetime without the constant aim towards something, to get something?<br><br>Is it possible to enjoy this experience even if we\u2019re \"not going anywhere?\u201d<br><br>If we're willing to consider this, we might discover that old age actually can bring peace and acceptance, exactly because it comes with finally surrendering those lifelong demands over existence.<br><br>Turns out, \u201cThis is it,\u201d is peaceful. &nbsp;Turns out, \u201cThere is no point,\u201d is an \u201cAhhh.\u201d Turns out, not trying to fight existence, is a relief.<br><br>No longer hurling ourselves at the unmovable brick wall actually feels better.<br><br>So if \"better\" is what is wanted, we might make a note of where it hangs out.<br><br>And here\u2019s the often-unseen thing:<br><br>Whether any of this is known or not, understood or not, seen or not\u2026<br><br>This is still it.<br><br>Whether we ever do come to know that, or whether we continue to think improvement is important, or whether we never stop thinking we need enlightenment, safety or love\u2026<br><br>It\u2019s still the case that this, this present, is it.<br><br>It's all there is. It's all we get.<br><br>Liked or not.<br><br>So could it be...<br><br>it\u2019s enough?<br><br>Maybe even more than enough?<br><br>Maybe even\u2026<br><br>Everything?<br><br>I mean....<br><br>Can\u2019t get more more than that.<br><br><br><em>\u201cIt is only when<br>The very idea of changing is seen<br>As false that<br>One can perceive the changeless.\u201d &nbsp;Wu Hsin<\/em><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click to get the Mind-Tickler<\/a> every week &nbsp;<br><br>","extra":""}
