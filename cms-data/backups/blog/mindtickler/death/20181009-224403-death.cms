Decades have gone into improving it, calming it, evolving it. All that organic kale. All those sit-ups. Suntan lotion. Satsangs. Therapy.<br><br>And then death comes along and says, \u201cOk honey, time for the heart to stop now. Buh-bye.\u201d<br><br>And we\u2019re disappeared. &nbsp;<br><br>So much time has gone into pretending this Self exists and that it's the center of everything, and then in the end we disappear anyway.<br><br>Sheesh.<br><br>So naturally we fear death. We're terrified of losing this carefully maintained Self. We reject anything that shows so completely and unarguably how powerless, unimportant, and insignificant these Me thingies are.<br><br>We hate that we\u2019re not the center of existence. We hate that there doesn\u2019t seem to be a center of existence.<br><br>Dammit.<br><br>And then, Life has the gall to go on. Without us. Without the Me.<br><br>Noooooo!<br><br>Although\u2026<br><br>It could be that even though the individual appears to be gone, something remains.<br><br>Because while the personality does seem to leave, along with our particular story, stories aren\u2019t alive. They\u2019re fiction. Fiction can\u2019t die.<br><br>Which means the stories don't really die.<br><br>Besides, is that what we are? A personality? A story?<br><br>Maybe we\u2019ve had it all wrong, all this time.<br><br>Maybe we don\u2019t actually die.<br><br>Like, ever.<br><br>Yes the body dies. But whatever it is that makes us what we are, whatever it is that animates the body\u2026 does it die?<br><br>That, whatever-it-is, is not physical. It's not biological. It's not a thing, not living, not breathing, not locatable.<br><br>How would that die or disappear? And where would it go, that it isn\u2019t already?<br><br>So, in terms of what we really are, whether it's an alive body or a dead one- maybe it's all the same either way. &nbsp;<br><br>Which makes death a non-event. Since what we really are has never been alive to begin with.<br><br>There is amazing peace in surrendering to the truth of this. &nbsp;<br><br>Without the lie of This-Body-Is-My-Self, without the limitation of constant Self-maintenance, what\u2019s left is diffuse, quiet, connected to and as everything, steady, everywhere, and infinite.<br><br>There's nothing left to protect or package or improve. There's nothing left to be afraid of.<br><br>And there\u2019s nothing left to be unhappy about that.<br><br>What freedom.<br><br>Plenty to not hate in that.<br><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\">Click to get in on the Mind-Tickler every week<\/a><br>","extra":""}
