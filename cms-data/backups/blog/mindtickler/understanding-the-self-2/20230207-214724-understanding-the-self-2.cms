There is only self. We are awareness. We are objects within awareness. We are appearances in awareness. I am that. I am nothing. I am everything. I am conscious. I am consciousness. I\u2019m in relationship with consciousness.<br><br>And of course my personal favorite: I'm aware of awareness.<br><br>Sure, let\u2019s make the thing that is aware of the thing be aware of being aware of the thing.<br><br>Got it? Yay!<br><br>This is what happens when we turn to the mind- whatever that is- to figure things out.<br><br>Because even when we have absolute certainty that we know the answers and get it\u2026<em> have <\/em>we got the answers?&nbsp;<em>Do<\/em>&nbsp;we get it?<br><br>After all, thought depends on itself to see itself. It depends on itself to understand itself.<br><br>Making for a very biased and selective \"understanding.\"<br><br>Comprehension is always limited by the capabilities of the thing doing the comprehending.<br><br>And in this regard, that thing is not big enough for the job.<br><br>This is a key flaw in all those inquiries, enlightenment methods, attempts to \u201csee beyond\u201d the self, and self improvements.<br><br>I mean, we also don\u2019t know what the self&nbsp;is,&nbsp;let alone how to improve or enlighten it.<br><br>It\u2019s just not possible to know what\u2019s bigger than ourselves.<br><br>So any claims of understanding are&nbsp;self-serving.<br><br>In every sense of that very apt expression.<br><br>And no matter how much we may insist when we think we know something... we\u2019re being played the fool by thought.<br><br>Because the mind only pretends to understand. While actually not the least bit interested in understanding.<br><br>I mean, what would happen if thinking was able to truly see how nothing, insignificant, limited and unimportant, it really is?<br><br>Yeah, no way thought\u2019s going to be good with that.<br><br>So the only reasonable state is ever, \u201cI don't know.\u201d<br><br>Because honey, we don\u2019t.<br><br>No matter how articulately anyone expounds their point of view, it remains an opinion.<br><br>So all the blah blah about consciousness and awareness and self and \u201cI am\u201d?<br><br>Masturbatory nonsense. Just mind playing with itself.<br><br>And yes it may be comforting to think we understand consciousness. But really we're never truly going to be able to do anything but guess.<br><br>Even though mind loudly insists it knows something.<br><br>Nothing wrong with any of this, of course.<br><br>It\u2019s fine to play with our selves. Nothing wrong with a little self manipulation.<br><br>It's just that we\u2019ll wait forever for that happy ending.<br><br>Silly, unsatisfied little things.<br><br>Aren\u2019t we adorable?<br><br><br><strong>Click here to get your Mind-Tickled every week.<\/strong>","extra":"","extra2":""}
