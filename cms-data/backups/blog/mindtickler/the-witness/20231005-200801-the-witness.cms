Who knows. I just have a point of view like you do, (albeit in this case, most likely controversial and not the same as yours.)<br><br>Lots of teachers talk about \u201cbeing The Witness.\u201d Being aware of your self, your thoughts, your feelings. Watching as if you\u2019re not you, as if you\u2019re something other than you.<br><br>And then, being aware of this awareness.<br><br>Most mediations and spiritual inquiries are built on this. Some folks, many folks, even define enlightenment as becoming aware of this Witness, this Awareness.<br><br>Which of course is fine. I get it. It\u2019s great to watch thoughts and feelings and see that they aren\u2019t you. That distance from the person feels&nbsp;way&nbsp;better than the belief that the person is what you are.<br><br>Since being a person comes with lots and lots of doesn\u2019t-feel-great.<br><br>So noticing awareness can be a very worthy exercise.<br><br>Like hamstring curls, or crunches.<br><br>From where I sit though, it\u2019s a trap. A whole lot of people get stuck there, in confusion and misunderstanding.<br><br>The idea that awareness is something that needs to be \u201cconnected to,\u201d something you need to<em>&nbsp;do<\/em>,&nbsp;generates a sense of levels- a sense of not-there-and-needing-to-get-there. Of course there\u2019s always another level to attain and witness.<br><br>Being aware of awareness subtly perpetuates a sense of solidity, control, and doingness, enabling&nbsp;and confirming the sense of self, as opposed to seeing through it.<br><br>Nothing wrong with this and again, it can, and often does, feel better. It just may perhaps be the opposite of what is being sought by all that noticing in the first place.<br><br>Meanwhile, when Rupert Spira says, <em>\u201cFew people are aware that they are aware. Most people\u2019s lives consist of a flow of thoughts, images, ideas, feelings, sensations, sights, sounds, and so on.
