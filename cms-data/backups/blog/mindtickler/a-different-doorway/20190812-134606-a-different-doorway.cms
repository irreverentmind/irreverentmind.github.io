My loyalty is to the vision, whenever and howsoever it may arrive.\" --Mary Oliver<\/em><br><br>Let\u2019s generate some new ideas. Or make a needed decision. Or how about solving a problem that\u2019s been hanging around.<br><br>If you\u2019re an artist, go on and create the new painting, write the brilliant piece, choreograph the dance.<br><br>If you\u2019re not an artist, hey no biggie, so what? You\u2019re in charge here. Go ahead, do it anyway.<br><br>Right now.<br><br>No?<br><br>Well, OK, maybe genius will come in the shower, or in the middle of the night, or on a walk. And maybe you\u2019ll even remember it in the morning.<br><br>It\u2019s slippery though- even when it's written down, it may still irretrievably slide away.<br><br>As it pleases.<br><br>How weird that we haven\u2019t noticed that we can\u2019t generate ideas on our command, that inventiveness is not ours, that we are not the ones who solve problems.<br><br>How weird to not notice that we have to get lucky, both to have inspiration show up in the first place, and then to hold on to it once it does.<br><br>Yes we do say, \u201cI painted that,\u201d or \u201cI had an idea,\u201d or \u201cI wrote a book.\u201d &nbsp;And yes we do take credit for bringing it and doing it.<br><br>Even though the idea that we are the ones creating and solving so often comes with failure, stress, lack of motivation, writer\u2019s block, decision-stuckness, and apparently unsolvable problems.<br><br>Oh yay, give us more o\u2019 that.<br><br>Perhaps we\u2019re not the all-powerful Oz after all.<br><br>Because as it turns out, zero ideas actually come from us.<br><br>Unless we\u2019re counting judgment, dissatisfaction, disapproval, and criticism of whatever ideas do come through.<br><br>All of which is the opposite of inspiration. And paralyzing. And can even make us feel like an imposter.<br><br>Which happens to be true, if we think we are the ones who come up with brilliance.<br><br>So.... what does send ideas, if it\u2019s not us? What is in charge of creativity?<br><br>Well whatever it is, it\u2019s Not-Me.<br><br>It\u2019s biiiiiiiiiiiig. &nbsp;Way bigger than li'l ol' us.<br><br>Not to mention genius, with unlimited ingenuity. Because there\u2019s always more; it never runs out.<br><br>I mean, it would seem we\u2019re not even necessary.<br><br>Now, the ego may pout at seeing this.<br><br>But luckily for us, ideas have to have a vehicle. They need to occur to something, or else....<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>Creativity needs our hardware. &nbsp;It needs us to implement.<br><br>So we\u2019ve got a partnership, a collaboration.<br><br>Creativity provides the magic, and humans provide the molding of the clay, the moving of feet, the typing things out.<br><br>Yes we\u2019re just being driven.<br><br>But at least we get to go for the ride.<br><br>And at least we\u2019re in good hands. Because this driver offers something far bigger, with infinite perspective, infinite options, and far more wisdom than we're ever going to have.<br><br>Ok fine, why does this matter?<br><br>Well, besides that it feels so much better when we see that we\u2019re not to blame when ideas don't come...<br><br>For those readers who care about having some understanding of consciousness...<br><br>There can be many ways to access this enlightenment thing.<br><br>I mean, maybe we don\u2019t have to sit cross-legged in meditation chanting OM through third eyes. Maybe we don\u2019t have to inquire into every thought, or memorize every word and hiccup Nisargadatta ever uttered.<br><br>Maybe there are other, possibly even better, ways out of the personality, out of the self.<br><br>Maybe creativity offers a different kind of meditation, a different kind of doorway.<br><br>Because what might happen when we\u2019re able to get the Me out of the way, and let something bigger do its thing?<br><br>On its own terms, unimpeded by human shoulds and shouldn\u2019ts and deadlines and clocks?<br><br>What might happen when we can set aside notions that we are The Creators, and instead let something else blow vision and wisdom and imagination and solutions right on through us, like a flute?<br><br>Vehicle, not driver.<br><br>Who knows? We might find that's peaceful. Expansive. Maybe even blissful.<br><br>We might find relief from self-blame and haranguing voice.<br><br>We might find gratitude for smallness, for unimportance, and for the simple ability to be driven...<br><br>By dazzling enormity.<br><br>So it could be fun to get in the passenger side, and see where this baby goes.<br><br>Because pretty likely, it\u2019s somewhere we didn\u2019t know how to get to,<br><br>Ourselves.<br><br><br>Click here to get your <a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bQJg9v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mind-Tickled<\/a> every week.<br><br><em>\"Art is Consciousness expressing Itself unimpeded by all those fallacious appearances of a \u201cMe\u201d.
