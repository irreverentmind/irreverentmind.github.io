Or maybe it will open some mind-doors for you.<br><br>Either way, it\u2019s just fiction. Not meant to be accurate, not meant to be Truth, not meant to be The Answer.<br><br>So hopefully you\u2019ll be able to gather up your popcorn and enjoy the fantasy.<br><br>Imagine that you are consciousness, floating above this planet.<br><br>You have no body, no hands, no feet, no ears. You\u2019re just, well\u2026<br><br>Nothing. &nbsp;<br><br>And imagine that you want experience; you want something to be conscious <em>of<\/em>.<br><br>Because consciousness isn\u2019t anything if it isn\u2019t conscious <em>of&nbsp;<\/em>something.<br><br>But there\u2019s no way to experience anything, to register anything, if there isn't a place for experience to land.<br><br>Being conscious, experiencing, requires hardware. &nbsp;It requires receptors, like eyes or tentacles, for example.<br><br>In order to hear, to feel, to see, receptors are necessary.<br><br>So imagine that you\/consciousness break up into billions of little pieces and drop down into hardware.<br><br>You drop into bodies. You join with various life forms.<br><br>(Ok Ok. If mind-revolt is kicking in, remember it\u2019s just a story.)<br><br>Now in a body, you can hear, touch, feel, cry, smell.<br><br>You can be what you are.<br><br>Conscious.<br><br>An infinite amount of experience is now available.<br><br>And it's happening!<br><br>Wow! Now there\u2019s red and black and loud and soft and rain and sun and sweet and sour and Mother Theresa and Hitler and Trump and Bernie and tears and bliss and love and hate and pain and orgasm and...<br><br>Wow!<br><br>Can you see that you might want it <em>all<\/em>? &nbsp;<br><br>Without preference, without one experience being better or worse than another?<br><br>We might imagine consciousness saying \u2018Yes!\u2019 to everything.<br><br>Because there is an infinite amount of evidence that it doesn\u2019t only want the happy blissed-out stuff.<br><br>And now turning attention to the bit of consciousness that has dropped down into hardware\u2026<br><br>We might notice that in that bit, in that body, there might be a very strong longing to reconnect with the whole, with what it really is.<br><br>There might be a sense of incompleteness, of not-enough-ness.<br><br>There might be a sense of something off, of wrongness, of \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with me.\u201d<br><br>Because when it thinks it\u2019s a bit, it has to feel incomplete. Deficient. &nbsp;Lacking. &nbsp;Wanting.<br><br>Because, if it's a bit, it<em> is <\/em>incomplete.<br><br>And perhaps we might also notice how much the bit invests in bit-ness.<br><br>How it goes all out trying to be better and to improve itself (\u201cI need to get better, do better, feel better, think better!\u201d)<br><br>And how urgently it pretends to be separate, unique (even though that hurts).<br><br>Watch as it tries to fit in and belong, to follow rules, get approval, meet standards, be well-thought-of, appear \u201cnormal.\u201d<br><br>Watch how desperately it hides that sense of itself as not enough.<br><br>Even from itself.<br><br>Not realizing that all those others -the ones it\u2019s comparing itself to- are also feeling not-enough and pretending, hiding and trying to improve.<br><br>The nerds and the bullies, the angry exes, the rich neighbors, the tribal leaders and teachers\u2026<br><br>All similarly striving to hide their incompleteness.<br><br>All pretending and hoping not to be discovered as inadequate bits of consciousness.<br><br>And yet\u2026<br><br>Meanwhile\u2026<br><br>Is it even possible to break up consciousness into bits?<br><br>How does one separate nothing? What would do this separating?<br><br>And how could conscious go somewhere (say\u2026 into bodies) that it wasn\u2019t already? &nbsp;How would that work, exactly?<br><br>Turns out that despite humans\u2019 strong sense of disconnection from the whole, consciousness can\u2019t be cut up into pieces.<br><br>So we are already connected to each other and to the whole.<br><br>Because we ARE the whole.<br><br>We are already complete.<br><br>We are already enough.<br><br>Even though we don't think so, we are one whole experience.<br><br>Perceived to be individualized.<br><br>But not actually individualized.<br><br>We\u2019re the experience of being both a separate person and also the whole of consciousness.<br><br>Simultaneously.<br><br>We\u2019re both.<br><br>We don\u2019t need to pick one.<br><br>One isn\u2019t better than the other.<br><br>We\u2019re all of it, all the time.<br><br>Whether the individual realizes it or not.<br><br>We are... that... whole.<br><br>That complete.<br><br>And with that completeness, our story ends\u2026<br><br>And we all live...<br><br>Ever after.<br><br>No matter what experience happens.<br><br>The End.<br><br>","extra":""}
