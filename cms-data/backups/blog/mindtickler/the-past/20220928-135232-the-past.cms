Beck, MD<\/em><br><br>I remember playing at the beach at 5, wearing my cousin\u2019s red bathing suit. I remember being bullied. I remember painting with my grandfather, getting a D in every high school class just to piss off my mother, being jealous of my friend\u2019s normal family. &nbsp;I remember panic attacks in college, dancing in the school play, singing \u201cO Holy Night\u201d for auditorium. I remember depression, enlightenment experiences, fights with boyfriends, money fears, triumphs and pats on the back, watching my grandmother bake.<br><br>Memories. I\u2019ve got \u2018em. You do too.<br><br>We have a past, a history. And the memories to prove it.<br><br>Because the past did happen, right? I mean, look, there are even photos- here\u2019s a little girl at a beach wearing a red bathing suit.<br><br>So what are they, these memories, these provers of reality and past?<br><br>Well, they\u2019re images. We say, \u201cI was at the beach,\u201d and mentally see the beach.<br><br>We see it now. Sitting in a chair at home, thinking about the beach.<br><br>That is not a real beach. We can\u2019t swim there. That\u2019s mental pixels.<br><br>Even \u201creal\u201d proofs of the past, like photographs or videos, are also images. They are also not the past, not the beach, not our parents, not soldiers, not 1910.<br><br>They are stand-ins, indications, representations,&nbsp;of&nbsp;a past.<br><br>So where's the real thing?<br><br>Oh dear. Maybe we're hallucinating it? I mean, per Mr. Webster: \u201cHallucinate: to experience a seemingly real perception of something not actually present.\u201d<br><br>Hmmmm. Apparently all of us are indeed mass-hallucinating and buying into images of something not actually present, as if they are real.<br><br>Because the past itself does not exist. It\u2019s a picture.<br><br>Otherwise, if the past is a real thing, where did it go, where is it now? What does it look like when it shows up for a visit?<br><br>It seems humans hallucinate&nbsp;all the time.&nbsp;Even the&nbsp;NOW,&nbsp;that much-vaunted present, is also a hallucination.<br><br>But that may be harder to see.<br><br>It's just that we don\u2019t think of the present as formative. Whereas almost everyone believes the past created us and made us who we are.<br><br>Even though whatever happened, whatever we lived through, was only known by colors and shapes appearing in&nbsp;our own&nbsp;eyeballs, sounds falling on&nbsp;our own&nbsp;ears, sensations occurring in&nbsp;our ownfingertips.<br><br>Experiences depending on us. Happening to us alone. Here in that moment (if at all) and then gone.<br><br>Nonexistent unless we perceive it.<br><br>And then, from these personal perceptions, we make inferences, meaning, convictions and absolute certainties of reality.<br><br>And of ourselves.<br><br>So naturally we're going to hold onto a few of those. We're going to call them&nbsp;memories, and&nbsp;the past,&nbsp;and&nbsp;trauma,&nbsp;and&nbsp;life story.&nbsp;We're going to tell&nbsp;those stories as explanations of things happening today.<br><br>And we're all going to pretend these past experiences are here still, held in us somewhere, stuck in there forever, directing current life like some kind of miniature mad-person in the forehead, waiting to come out at the most inconvenient times later.<br><br>\u201cIt was terrible and it made me who I am today.\u201d \u201cI still have dreams about my parents- they still affect me today, though they are long gone.\u201d<br><br>Creating the&nbsp;Me.<br><br>Perceptions and memories and histories are how we prove we exist.<br><br>As a person.<br><br>Humans reify hallucinations in order to verify who we are. A whole person, a whole Me, is built around them.<br><br>Because without a past,&nbsp;what\u2019s left? What are we?<br><br>Could it be nothing?<br><br>Oh dear.<br><br>Better to put the past on a pedestal, honor it, study it, enshrine it with memory, call it reality, and think it means something.<br><br>And then hold on tight.<br><br>Never ever release it.<br><br>Even if it hurts.<br><br>Ok but ugh, for crying out loud, Mind-Tickler, who cares? What good does all this theoretical blather about the past and memory and hallucination do for anyone anyway? No one needs this.<br><br>Yes of course that\u2019s true.<br><br>It\u2019s true we have to live in this world. We can\u2019t wipe out stories of little girls in red bathing suits.<br>We can\u2019t wipe out Hitler and walks on the moon and radiation and dinosaurs and yesterday and deceased family members.<br><br>The illusion must continue. Hallucinations are required. It is necessary to buy in.<br><br>There really is no alternative.<br><br>It\u2019s just that untethering from the usual certainties, even just a little, can bring surprises.<br><br>If we are willing to consider that, \u201cOnce upon a time\u201d is not reality, never has been what we are, and hasn\u2019t necessarily even&nbsp;created&nbsp;what we are-<br><br>because really how can any image create a person- especially a person&nbsp;later-<br><br>well then who knows? The next realization might be that we\u2019re not weighted down by what we think we are, at all.<br><br>We might discover that if we\u2019re only story, then we\u2019re nothing at all.<br><br>Which is something a lot of Mind-tickler readers really want to understand.<br><br>The past is an imaginary leash.<br><br>Unchain from that anchor, with all its trauma, suffering, and heaviness pinning the self down,<br><br>And there may be nothing left to hold the usual balloon of Me<br><br>From floating free.<br><br>Which just might be something,<br><br>if we can remember,<br><br>to hold onto<br><br>Lightly.<br><br><br><em>\u201cWe think that the world is limited and explained by its past. We tend to think that what happened in the past determines what is going to happen next, and we do not see that it is exactly the other way around! What is always the source of the world is the present; the past doesn't explain a thing. The past trails behind the present like the wake of a ship and eventually disappears.\u201d<br>--Alan Watts<br><br>----------<br><br>\"There is neither past nor future. There is only the present.
